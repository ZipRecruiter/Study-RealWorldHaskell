<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><a name="allergy"><!-- --></a><b>Researchers prove the validity of carrot allergy</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Allergic reactions to carrot and celery are very uncommon in the United States, however, <img src="photos/whitecarrot.jpg" width="250" height="188" alt="white carrot" align="right" />reactions to carrots affect up to 25% of food-allergic individuals in Europe, and are associated with cross sensitivity to celery, certain spices, mugwort, and birch pollen. Several European researchers were recently able to prove the allergenicity of carrot for the first time in a study from the August Journal Allergy &amp; Clinical Immunology. Barbara Ballmer-Weber, MD, and colleagues from University Hospital in Zurich, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany and the University of Vienna, sought to confirm sensitization to carrot by conducting several different tests on 26 patients with a history of allergic reactions to carrots.<br />
Two food challenges were performed. The first was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), where subjects were given two different drinks: one was an active drink containing carrot and the other was a placebo drink. The second food challenge performed was a spit and chew test. The patients with a negative reactions in the DBPCFC chewed 5 g of raw carrot and spit it out. If they did not experience a reaction, they chewed and swallowed 5 g, then 10 g, and then 20 g of raw carrot. Skin tests and in vitro blood tests were performed to check for the presence of IgE, the antibody that produces allergic reactions. In vitro testing was also performed to see if allergic sensitivity to birch pollen initially triggered the sensitivity to carrots in these individuals.<br />
<br />
In the first food challenge, researchers found that 20 patients reacted to the carrot-containing drink but not the placebo. Four patients responded to neither the carrot-containing drink nor the placebo drink. In the spit and chew test, three of these latter four subjects noted no symptoms. The fourth patient reported symptoms of oral allergy syndrome (itching of the throat and mouth) after swallowing 5 g of raw carrot. Researchers found that all patients who had positive DBPCFC's also had positive skin test results to raw carrot, while all patients who had negative DBPCFC's had negative skin tests and did not have subsequent reactions to the ingestion of carrot. Additionally, all of the carrot-allergic patients also had birch pollen specific IgE. However, in vitro testing of the serum from the carrot-allergic patients revealed that allergic binding could not be blocked by birch pollen proteins.<br />
<br />
For the first time researchers were able to confirm carrot allergy in 20 of 26 European patients using DBPCFC protocol with carrot. Although these allergic patients produced IgE to both carrot and birch pollens, in vitro testing seemed to discount the theory that exposure to airborne birch pollen always precedes and predisposes allergic patients to the development of carrot allergies.<br />
The AAAAI is the largest professional medical specialty organization in the United States representing allergists, asthma specialists, clinical immunologists, allied health professionals and others with a special interest in the research and treatment of allergic disease. Allergy/immunology specialists are pediatric or internal medicine physicians who have elected an additional two years of training to become specialized in the treatment of asthma, allergy and immunologic disease. Established in 1943, the Academy has more than 6,000 members in the United States, Canada and 60 other countries. The Academy serves as an advocate to the public by providing educational information through its Web site.<a href="#" onclick="MyWindow=window.open('http://www.aaaai.org','MyWindow','toolbar=yes,location=yes,directories=yes,status=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300'); return false;" title="The Academy's web site - opens in new window">&nbsp; Click here to go there.</a></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><i>(source <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/carrot-allergy" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/carrot-allergy</a>)</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<b>The basics</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Carrots bring sweetness, color, and nutrition to many dishes. This vegetable is rich in beta carotene and fiber. For those who are allergic, carrots are also chock-full of potentially harmful allergens.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">A member of the parsley-carrot family (Apiaceae), carrots are more likely to cause allergic reactions when eaten raw than when cooked. This is because cooking unravels the allergenic proteins in carrots and lessens the impact they have on the immune system.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Allergic reactions to carrots can range from mild to serious. As with any allergy, consulting with a doctor can help you manage your symptoms.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>What are the symptoms of a carrot allergy?</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Carrot allergy symptoms are most often associated with oral allergy syndrome. Symptoms typically occur when a piece of raw carrot is in the mouth. And symptoms go away as soon as the carrot is removed or swallowed.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>Symptoms can include:</b>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">itchy mouth</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">swelling of the lips, mouth, tongue, or throat</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">itchy ears</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">scratchy throat</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">These symptoms usually don�t require treatment or medication. More severe symptoms may require medication, such as an antihistamine. These symptoms include:&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">swelling under the skin</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">hives</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">difficulty breathing</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">dizziness</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">tightness in the throat or chest</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">difficulty swallowing</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">sore throat or hoarseness</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">cough</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">runny nose</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">sneezing</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">nasal congestion</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">irritated, itchy eyes</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">anaphylaxis</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>Risk factors and cross-reactive foods</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">If you�re allergic to carrots, there are several other foods and plants you might be allergic to. This is known as cross-reactivity. For example, people who are allergic to carrots are often allergic to birch pollen. This is because carrots and birch pollen have similar proteins and can cause your immune system to react in the same way. Your body releases histamine and antibodies to fight off the proteins, causing allergy-related symptoms. You may also be allergic to other vegetables and herbs in the parsley-carrot family.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">These include: parsnip, parsley, anise, chervil, celery, fennel, caraway, dill, cumin, coriander</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>Are complications possible?</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Although carrot allergy is uncommon, it can cause serious complications for some people. Occasionally, a whole-body reaction, called anaphylaxis, may occur. Anaphylaxis can happen even if you�ve only had mild allergic reactions to carrots in the past. It�s potentially fatal and requires immediate medical attention.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Anaphylaxis may begin with mild allergic symptoms, such as itchy eyes or a runny nose, within minutes or hours after exposure to an allergen. Other symptoms of anaphylaxis include: swelling of the mouth, lips, and throat; wheezing, gastrointestinal problems, such as vomiting and diarrhea.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">If anaphylaxis escalates and is left untreated, you may experience difficulty breathing, dizziness, low blood pressure, and even death.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;If you or someone else appears to be having an anaphylactic allergic reaction, call your local emergency services and get medical help immediately.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">If your doctor is concerned about your allergies and anaphylaxis, you may be prescribed an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen), which you will need to carry around at all times.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">You�d think a food as colorful as carrots would always be obvious to the eye, but that�s not always the case. Because of their sweet, earthy flavour, carrots are often used as an ingredient in products you typically wouldn�t suspect. If you have carrot allergy, you�ll need to be vigilant about checking labels and asking about a meal�s ingredients when you eat out.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;Products that may include carrots are: bottled marinade, packaged rice mixes; fruit and vegetable juices; fruit smoothies; �green� blended health drinks; certain soups, such as chicken or vegetable soups; canned stew; ready-made pot roast, brisket, and other roasted meat dishes; cooking broth; baked goods.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Carrot can also be found in some personal hygiene products, such as: facial scrub, masks, lotions, cleansers.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<b>When to see your doctor</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">If you experience an allergic reaction to carrot, it may help to see your doctor while the reaction is occurring, or shortly after. If your allergy symptoms persist or worsen, you should consult with your doctor. Your doctor may recommend that you use over-the-counter antihistamines to control or reduce your symptoms. If you experience any symptoms of anaphylaxis, you should seek immediate medical attention.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>Outlook</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">If you have, or suspect you have, a carrot allergy, talk to your doctor. Many medications can help you manage or reduce your allergy symptoms, The best way to avoid symptoms is to avoid carrots and products that contain carrots. And it�s important that you read all product labels.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>What can I use as a substitute?</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Foods to try - Pumpkin, Sweet potatoes and&nbsp; Squash</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Carrots are a wonderful source of beta carotene, which the body turns into vitamin A. If you�re unable to eat carrots, the best way to ensure that you get enough of this all-important nutrient is to go for other foods that are the same bright orange colour. Pumpkin and sweet potatoes are both great sources of beta carotene. They can generally be used as substitutes for carrots in many recipes.</font></p>
