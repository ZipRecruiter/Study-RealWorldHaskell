<p align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF" size="5"><a name="eat more"></a>Why everyone should eat more Carrots</font></b></p>
<p>Carrots are naturally low in calories An 80g serving of cooked carrots contains just 24 calories, making them a great choice if you�re watching your weight.</p>
<p>Carrots are naturally low in fat and saturates Health experts recommend we eat less fat and fewer saturates to keep our hearts healthy. This makes carrots a great choice. An 80g serving of cooked carrots contains just 0.3g fat and 0.1g saturates.</p>
<p>Carrots count towards your five-a-day Like all veg, an 80g serving of carrots � that�s equivalent to about � a medium-sized carrot or three heaped tablespoons � counts as one of your five portions of fruit and veg. Better still, all carrots including fresh, frozen and canned count, whether they�re served as a side dish, cooked in a soup or stew, raw in a salad or made into a juice.</p>
<p>Carrots are naturally low in salt Good news! carrots are naturally low in salt To stay healthy and reduce your risk of getting high blood pressure, nutrition experts recommend having no more than 6g of salt a day.. An 80g serving of cooked carrots contains just 0.1g salt, providing you haven�t added salt to the cooking water.</p>
<p>Carrots are high in fibre Carrots are packed with fibre, which helps keep the digestive system healthy and helps balance blood sugar levels. Fibre also helps you to feel fuller for longer so you find it easier to maintain your weight. An 80g serving of cooked carrots contains 2g fibre � more than a tenth of the recommended daily amount for adults.</p>
<p>Carrots help boost our intake of vitamin A Vitamin A aids the growth of healthy bones and teeth. Carrots are packed with a nutrient called betacarotene, which is converted into vitamin A by the body.</p>
<p>Carrots are actually one of the best source of betacarotene. An 80g serving of cooked carrots contains more than twice the recommended daily amount (RDA) of vitamin A equivalent needed by adults. This is good news as many children and adults have poor intakes of this nutrient.</p>
<p>Carrots may help you see in the dark Beta-carotene found in large amounts in carrots is converted into vitamin A in the body and this vitamin is vital for healthy vision. Vitamin A works its eye health magic by being transformed into a purple pigment called rhodopsin in the retina, and this pigment is essential for vision in dim light.</p>
<p>Carrots are great for healthy, younger-looking skin Beta-carotene is also an important antioxidant nutrient. This is great news for our skin as its antioxidant action may help to act against age-accelerating free radicals, so that skin remains healthy and elastic. Carrots may help to protect your skin from sun damage When taken on a regular basis, beta-carotene can help to protect skin from excessive ultra-violet (UV) radiation and sunburn. That�s not to say you should ditch your sunscreen if you eat a lot of carrots! You should still follow sun safety advice and cover up during the hottest part of the day, wear a hat and regularly apply sun screen with a high SPF.</p>
<p>Carrots help to keep your immune system strong Vitamin A is essential for the proper functioning of the immune system. This nutrient keeps the skin and cells that line the airways, digestive tract and urinary tract healthy, so they act as barriers and form the body�s first line of defence against infection. Adding a little fat enhances the goodness of carrots in salad It might come as a surprise to learn that a little fat in your salad, benefits both taste and health. Research from Ohio State University in America found that more carotenoids such as beta-carotene were absorbed when a fresh salad consisting of carrots, romaine lettuce, spinach and cherry tomatoes was eaten with full-fat salad dressing compared with fat-free salad dressing � Vitamin A is soluble in fat, not in water, so it is not lost in body fluids.</p>
<p>Don�t worry about cooking carrots If your kids will only eat mashed carrot, don�t worry � it�s a nutritional bonus! Research shows more betacarotene is absorbed from cooked, pur�ed carrots than from raw ones.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0033FF" size="5"><a name="juice"></a>The Benefits of Carrot Juice</font></p>
<p>Eight ounces of carrot juice can contain as much as 800% of your daily recommended dosage of vitamin A. This Vitamin&nbsp; is essential and necessary for tissue growth, especially within the bones. Vitamin A is also very important in maintaining good vision. The old myth that eating carrots will help you see better is true, as vitamin A deficiencies can lead to vision problems such as night blindness.</p>
<p>Spinach is also a very rich source of Vitamin A. A little spinach juiced with a few carrots will deliver a vitamin A mega beverage. Vitamin A is also very crucial for expectant mothers and the unborn foetus. Although vitamin A is very important for your body, it is also important to maintain moderate levels of vitamin A intake, as too much can lead to liver toxicity, and other health problems.</p>
<p>Carrot juice is also an excellent source of vitamin C. An eight ounce glass of pure carrot juice can provide your body with up to 35% of your daily recommended dosage of vitamin C. Vitamin C has a wide variety of uses throughout our entire body, such as collagen production of the mucous membranes, skin, bones, and teeth. Vitamin C is also a very crucial antioxidant.</p>
<p>A few carrots juiced with blackcurrant berries, oranges, lemons, or kiwi, can easily provide you with your whole daily vitamin C dosage, without the need to take synthetic vitamins supplements.</p>
<p>Carrot juice is an excellent drinkable source of potassium. Potassium is very important in helping to maintain a healthy electrolyte balance and fluid level in the cells of your body. It's also necessary in muscle movement, such as contraction, as well as neurotransmission. Potassium deficiencies are very bad for your body, with such effects as Hypokalemia, acne, muscle spasms, dry skin, and elevated cholesterol levels. Carrots juiced with celery or turnips can provide your body with a large intake level of potassium.</p>
<p>An eight ounce glass of pure carrot juice will usually provide up to 10% of the daily recommended intake level of potassium. It should be known that individuals who suffer from kidney disease, should avoid taking in large amounts of potassium, as it can be very harmful on the organs.</p>
<p>Pure carrot juice is a very low calorie juice drink. Eight fluid ounces of the beverage yields usually no more then 80 calories. Carrot juice is an excellent nutritional supplement for dieters, providing you with a rich supply of essential vitamins and minerals, without being accompanied by all of the calories that a health shake might give you. For athletes and weightlifters, the calorie level of carrot juice can be upped by blending it with fruit yogurt, milk, ice cream, or a protein powder supplement. I have even heard of people blending the juice with rolled oats, cereal, or boiled rice to dramatically increase the calorie and nutritional levels.</p>
<p>Pure carrot juice in an eight ounce serving can provide up to 6% percent of your daily recommended intake level of calcium. It is very important to receive a healthy level of calcium in your daily diet. Bones and teeth are dependent on calcium for growth and formation, especially the skeletal structure and development of children. Calcium absorption should also be accompanied by vitamin D, which helps aid your body's intake of the mineral. Like potassium, calcium is important for neurotransmission, and muscle movement and contraction.</p>
<p>Carrots juiced with broccoli can provide an excellent vegetable calcium drink. For a calcium shake, you may also choose to juice your carrots and then blend it with yogurt for a carrot juice smoothie, which makes for a healthy breakfast shake, or evening dessert.</p>
