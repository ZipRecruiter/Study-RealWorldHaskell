<p align="left">In late 1941, Walt Disney offered to help the British Government promote carrots as a nutritious food source. Hank Porter, a leading Disney cartoonist&nbsp; designed a family of carrot characters on behalf of England's Food Minister (Lord Woolton). These were wired to London together with six US recipes and then reproduced on a poster, recipe booklet and flyers. The images were used extensively in a newspaper campaign.</p>
<p align="left"><span lang="EN-US">As the British Ministry of Food had already used their own Dr Carrot in their promotions, this Disney character was never used, and is lost to posterity. These images are reproduced from the originals.</span> <b>They are VERY rare!. <font color="#FF0000"><span lang="EN-US">Please do not copy them.</span></font></b></p>
