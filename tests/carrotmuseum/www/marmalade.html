<hr color="#FFA500" size="3" />
Marmalade is a fruit preserve made from the juice and peel of citrus fruits boiled with sugar and water. It can be produced from kumquats, lemons, limes, grapefruits, mandarins, sweet oranges, bergamots and other citrus fruits, or any combination thereof. for the last 1500 years at least, various forms of marmalade have been enjoyed as a sweetened fruit preserve with long keeping qualities. The Greeks melmelo (raw or cooked quinces and honey) in earthenware jars to use during times of scarcity.
<p><b>Pectin</b> (natural setting agent) According to dietaryfiberfood.com, carrots have the most pectin of all the vegetables. Carrots have 0.8 g of pectin per 100 g serving. Carrots are loaded with a wide variety of vitamins and the pectin they contain can help lower your cholesterol. <a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/367234-list-of-vegetables-high-in-pectin/">https://www.livestrong.com/article/367234-list-of-vegetables-high-in-pectin/</a>&nbsp; This makes carrots eminently suitable for making marmalade and jam set easily.</p>
<p>The benchmark citrus fruit for marmalade production in Britain is the Spanish Seville orange, Citrus aurantium var. aurantium, prized for its high pectin content, which gives a good set. The peel has a distinctive bitter taste which it imparts to the marmalade.</p>
<p>Marmalade is generally distinguished from jam by its fruit peel. It may also be distinguished from jam by the fruits used. The first record of a Marmalade occurred in the recipe book of Madam Eliza Cholmondeley, dated around 1677 and held at the Chester Record Office. It has one of the earliest recipes (for a Marmelet of Oranges) that compares to the marmalade we know today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was recommended to Captain Cook in 1771 by Baron Storch of Berlin as a cure for scurvy. <a href="#cpncook">Read more here</a></p>
<p>He evaporated carrot juice to the thickness of treacle. Following this advice Captain Cook set off to discover the New World in 1772, reaching the Cape of Good hope after a 3 months voyage. The voyage carried amongst its provision some 30 gallons of Carrot Marmalade. Cook�s ship, the Resolution finally docked in New Zealand after 117 days at sea, the good state of the men's health was partly attributed to the ingestion of Carrot Marmalade, to help ward off scurvy. The mammoth journey ended in 1776 with an astonishing record of only one man being lost from sickness and that was not from scurvy! <i><font size="2">(source History of Scurvy and Vitamin C, by Ken J Carpenter, 1988 extract below)</font></i></p>

<p><b>Is a Carrot a <a name="veg">Vegetable or Fruit?</a></b></p>
<p>For the purposes of the European Union's "Council Directive 2001/113/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and sweetened chestnut pur�e intended for human consumption" carrots can be defined as a fruit as well as a vegetable. <font face="Arial">The Directive, written in the 80s and updated in 2001 describes the parameters required for a product to be labelled as jam or marmalade and from which the UK Jam and Similar Products legislation is based, there is the phrase "for the purposes of this directive, tomatoes, the edible part of rhubarb stalks, <font color="#FF0000">carrots</font>, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins, melons and water melons <font color="#FF0000">are considered to be fruit</font>". This was introduced to pacify the Portuguese who are strongly into Carrot Marmalade and it is quite a delicacy!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Of course carrots are not botanically a fruit as they do not carry the seeds, and the above paragraph in the jam directive does not reclassify them as such, just allows them to be used as fruit.</font></p>
<p align="left">Like a jam, this sweet marmalade uses carrots rather than traditional fruit, to provide extra dimensions of texture and flavour for a fun topping.&nbsp; <a href="jam.html">(CARROT JAM HERE)</a></p>

<p><b>Text of the letter -</b></p>
<p>"About the beginning of October when the Yellow Carrots are the Sweetest, you take fresh out of the Ground as many as you intend to make use of. Take care to chose them well, that none with black Spots be left between them.</p>
<p>You wash your Carrots sundry times &amp; clean them nicely of the Herb as well as of the Green Top.</p>
<p>If you intend to make but a Small quantity of the Marmalade you may grate your Carrots upon a Tin Grater but should you want any large quantity, you may mince or hatch the Carrots which you put into a Kettle And Add as much fresh water, that your Carrots be cover�d with about four inches with Water. You boil them over a Small fire until they are reduced to a pap, the Grated Carrots Want less boiling, the hatched ones must be boil�d about twelve hours, take a great care never to give too Much fire after they begin to boil &amp; to stir your Carrots now &amp; then of fear they may stick and burn beneath.</p>
<p>When your Carrots are boil�d enough, you must strain them well through a clean linen and press the Felt well, that all the juice may come out, the dregs are a good Food for Hogs, Geese &amp; Ducks. You put the filtrated Juice of Carrots into another Kettle &amp; boil it again over a small fire until it gets the thickness of a fluid honey, at this last boiling you must take great care by constant stirring and by small firing to prevent its sticking to the Kettle &amp; burning, which will give to your Marmalade a bitter and disagreeable taste.</p>
<p>When your Marmalade is enough boil�d and well done, you preserve it into Stone or Earth pots, well varnish�d &amp; keep it well cover�d with a Parchment or Bladder, if it is well made &amp; thick enough boil�d, it will preserve full two years.</p>
<p>Should your Marmalade spoil by some accident or other and get some moisture at the top, you take of the moisture with a Spoon and boil it again and it will regain its first sweetness.</p>
<p>Other method of making the Carrot Marmalade (transcript of above letter image)</p>
<p>You squeeze the Juice out of the grated or hatched Carrots and boil it immediately thick without any addition of water either over a Small fire or even over boiling water, you preserve it in the abovementioned way, but it will not keep above a twelve month.</p>
<p>In some Parts of Germany where many acres of Carrots are cultivated they make use of Oil Mills to squeeze the juice of the Carrots and boil it afterwards in the last mentioned manner.</p>
<p>One acre of good soil well plowed (ploughed) will want 24 ounces of carrot seeds, a less rich soil will want 2 pound of seed per acre.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The carrot don�t improve well in a well dung land."</p>
