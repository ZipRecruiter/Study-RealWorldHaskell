<p><font face="Arial">Carrots are great for your skin and body. They hydrate, brighten and take care of your skin, even if not oily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Carrot is a food rich in beta-carotene which the body converts into vitamin A, when it is consumed.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to eye health, the carrot is also good for skin health.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Not only are carrots good for your health, they can tone and clarify your skin, since they are naturally antiseptic and packed with vitamins and iron. Carrots are readily available all year round so your local grocery store should always have some in stock. Homemade masks made from carrots are most appropriate for people with normal to oily skin types but since you're the chef to these beauty recipes, you can include other ingredients that suit your own needs. For example you can add in extra doses of extra virgin olive oil or even half of a mashed avocado to create a hydrating mask</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">These recipes all incorporate the orange veggie into the list of ingredients that will leave your skin looking beautiful, young and fresh. So why use carrots, of all things? Carrots are great for oily skin and they revitalize dull and tired skin cells, too.

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Carrot Hair Detox</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This recipe is ridiculously simple and works wonders. The ingredient list consists of one item: a carrot. Take your small to medium sized carrot and shred/grate it into small pieces (as you would for carrot cake). Next, rub the grated carrot into your hair and let it set for 15 minutes. After you've finished waiting, rinse it out. You may need to collect the carrot pieces if they are too large to go down the drain! The finished product will be very clean hair with all that build-up rinsed away!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Carrot Peel Off Mask</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Peel off masks are great because they lift off dirt, oil and dead skin from your face. In fact, if you apply a peel off mask correctly all the gunk in your pores will adhere to the mask and when you peel it off be lifted away like magic! The key is to apply a very warm washcloth to your face for 15 minutes. Either that or sit in a room of steam for 15-20 minutes. Here's what you need to make this simple recipe work.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">1 tsp. Gelatin; � cup carrot juice; 1/2 tsp. Lemon juice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Once you've gathered these items, combine all three ingredients into a microwave-safe bowl and heat until the gelatin dissolves completely. Stir well and then place the mixture into your refrigerator for 20-30 minutes (or until the liquid becomes more thick and firm - don't let it set for too long or it will become solid, like Jell-O).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Next, apply the mixture to your face evenly and let it set until it is dried. Do this after steaming your face for the best effect. Peel off carefully and wash your face of any remaining residue. To finish, splash your face with cold water to tighten pores and gently pat dry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Carrot and Avocado Moisturizing Mask for Skin</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Use this recipe for areas of your body that are especially dry, including elbows, knees, ankles and feet. Here's what you need:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">1 avocado; 1 small-medium sized carrot; 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil; 1 tablespoon epsom salt</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">First, grate your carrot into small slivers (as you would for carrot cake). Next, cut your avocado and scoop out the meat. Place the vegetables into a medium sized bowl and mix well. Add your olive oil and epsom salt and stir until you have a consistent texture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Wash the area of your body which you plan to apply the mask. Scoop the mixture out and rub it in a circular motion - the salt with wipe away dead skin and the other ingredients will moisturize. Let the mask set for 20 minutes and rinse away with warm water.
