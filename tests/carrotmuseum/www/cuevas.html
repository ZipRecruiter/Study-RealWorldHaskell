<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Zanahoria Mora -</font> <font color="#0000FF"><b><font size="3">The 'carrot mor�' of Cuevas Bajas</font></b></font> <font size="3">- this unique vegetable from the municipality of Cuevas Baja, Malaga, Southern Spain.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The village of Cuevas Bajas &nbsp;is blessed with a unique variety of carrot, the so-called "zanahoria mor�", famous for its purple outer and unique centre. This peculiarity distinguishes this product from the rest of the known carrot festivals, which as we all know usually have an orange colour.</font> <img border="0" src="photos/cuevas9.jpg" alt="Cuevas Bajas Purple Carrot" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="180" height="168" /></p>
<p><font size="3">What distinguishes this carrot is that when it is sliced the core it has an orange colour, as with the traditional carrot, but it has a purple heart.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>There are some documents in the County Hall of Cuevas Bajas (Andalucia) that purport show the cultivation of an orange/purple variety from Medieval Times and there is a commercial letter talking about the exchange with the merchants of the Silk Route. It is said that the Arabs brought this variety from North Africa to Andalusia via the Silk Road in the 14th century.&nbsp; <i>This has yet to be examined by the Museum Curator</i>.</p>
<p><font size="3">The Zanahoria Mor� (Daucus carota L. ssp. sativus var. atrorubens) is a root with ancient origins. Cuevas Bajas, a picturesque village in the northeast of the province of M�laga, is located at the medieval Caliphate of Cordoba and Emirate of Granada settlements on the banks of the Genil River, an ideal framework for its preservation. Thanks to a pioneering project, this endangered species is being reintroduced to the local crops.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The authentic Black Carrot (Zanahoria Mor�) from Cuevas Bajas is preserved through a rigorous selection of seeds to perpetuate its distinctive characteristics such as a striking and unique violet heart with a wide range of shades of purple arranged in concentric circles. It is planted in early summer, and coinciding with the harvest in early December, a rare festival is celebrated in honour of this vegetable. During the celebration, all the goodness of this M�laga town is shown, and the black carrot is tasted through its many culinary uses.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The Cuevas Bajas purple carrot has roles in innumerable health benefits, containing six times more antioxidants than orange carrots. It is bneficial for regulating bowel functions, providing antiparasitic properties, stimulating appetite, relieving inflammatory symptoms, protecting against heart diseases, strengthening the immune system, preventing cellular aging, stabilizing blood glucose, and optimizing eye and skin health.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This purple carrot is considered to be the most original variety of carrot known to men. In fact, it was introduced by the Arabs in the Iberian Peninsula and it refused to changed its colour for the orange that the Dutch gave the now traditional carrots. To prevent this peculiar vegetable from disappearing, farmers from this area follow a very strict seed choice process. Because of that, they have managed to preserved its different characteristics: the inner yellow colour with a wide variety of purple tones spread throughout the carrot in concentric circles.</p>
<hr />
<p><font size="3">The festival is in its ninth year (2015) commencing with a carrot market, followed by children's activities, tasting bar with local wine and sausages, crumbs with the purple carrot (Migas) and lots more! Read about the <a href="#powder">purple carrot powder here</a>.</font></p>

<p align="left">John visited the Festival dedicated to a unique purple carrot in 2015. Every year on the first Sunday of December, the sleepy village of Cuevas Bajas, on the border between Malaga and Cordoba provinces, comes alive to celebrate the existence of their very own large purple carrots, with multi coloured center. There is also a man walking around the festival talking to people and having his picture taken in a full carrot costume. <i>(photo below)</i></p>
<p>A long white tent was erected in one of the town�s main roads and was lined with booths manned by local vendors selling their best products. After the official bits - speeches from the Mayor and local dignitaries - loud music filled the tent as a group of dancers encouraged the audience to have fun celebrating �la zanahoria mor�.� There were gorgeous crafts hand-painted in vibrant colours. There was a wide variety of gourmet cheeses, coffee liquor, dessert pastries and several types of meat. Despite the other attractions, the main star of the event was of course, the purple carrot, and it was featured at every single booth.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This purple carrot appears to be a quintessentially Andalusia phenomenon. Cuevas Bajas black carrots are rich sources of anthocyanins, a lot higher than traditional orange carrots. Considering the health benefits that have been associated with the consumption of anthocyanin-rich foods and diets, black carrot appears as an important food vegetable with good nutritional value. (<i><font size="2">Source: Anthocyanin profile and antioxidant capacity of black carrots (Daucus carota L. ssp. sativus var. atrorubens Alef.) from Cuevas Bajas, Spain - Article in Journal of Food Compoitgion and Analysis Feb 2014 - Manuel Argarra et al)</font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The festival attracts over 5,000 people (the normal population is around 2,000) It seems everyone knows everyone here, very much a family affair.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Originally it was established to celebrate the annual harvest and help preserve this unusual vegetable, which was recently at risk of extinction. There is a main tent and rows of outdoor stands where, among the various carrot based goods, other food products like resoli (a coffee liqueur) and the usual array of sausages are sold, while plates of Migas (fried breadcrumbs with meat) are dished out to the masses for free from an enormous pan.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The star of the show, the purple carrot, is characterised by its bright purple and orange core colour. The inside is streaky orange with a purple center, while the taste is less sweet than its traditional orange family member, it is still crunchy with a stronger, earthier flavour There is everything on sale from not only purple carrots, but also purple carrot cake, to crisps, to jam and liqueur. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The highlight of the day was the opportunity to enjoy unlimited free servings of one of Cuevas Bajas� most popular dishes: Migas topped with purple carrots. For those of you unfamiliar with Migas, it is a dish made with small pieces of stale bread, mixed with olive oil, fresh garlic, chorizo sausage and herbs and seasonings. It is then cooked in special shallow pan over a wood-burning fire. These pans tend to be large in general, but at this festival it is enormous. It took three people using farmers� rakes and hoes to cook the Migas for the hungry crowd awaiting their helping.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Below, the famous dish of Migas - literally crumbs or scraps. Typical recipe <a href="#migas">here.</a>&nbsp; More about the dish <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spanish-food.org/meat-stews-migas.html">here.</a></p>

It is a new type of dehydration that better preserves the nutritional elements of fruits and vegetables.</p>
