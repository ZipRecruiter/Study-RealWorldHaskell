<p align="left"><b>Introduction</b> - The prehistoric discovery that certain plants cause harm and others have curative powers is the origin of the healing professions and its practitioners (priest, physician, and apothecary), as well as professions devoted to plants (botany and horticulture). The description of plants and their prope<a href="herbals/germanherballge.jpg"><img border="0" src="herbals/german1600.jpg" align="right" alt="Germal Herbal Showing Orange Rooted Carrot 1600" width="188" height="293" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></a>rties and virtues (termed herbals in the 16th century) became an invaluable resource for the physician and apothecary. The earliest medico-botanical treatises date to antiquity.</p>
<p align="left">A Sumerian tablet from about 2100 BCE (before current era) contains a dozen prescriptions and proscribes plant sources. In China, the Pen T�Sao Ching, assumed to be authored by the legendary Emperor Shen Nung in �2700 BCE,� but probably written in the first century, contains about 100 herbal remedies. The Ebers Papyrus, a medical treatise from ancient Egypt dates to 1550 BCE but contains material from 5 to 20 centuries earlier. In Greece, the great botanical treatise Enquiry into Plants of Theophrastus, devotes book IX to the medicinal value of herbs. The herbal De Materia Medica by Pedanios Dioscorides of Anazarba, a Roman army physician, written in 65 A.D., the most famous ever written, was slavishly referred to, copied, and commented on for 1500 years. The great epoch of printed herbals appeared in the 16th century</p>
<p align="left">Many ancient societies have a body of traditional medicine, largely based on herbalism, that predates the invention of writing. It is not surprising that, as they became literate, those cultures felt the urge to commit that knowledge to writing - in the form of herbals. Before the advent of printing, herbals were produced as manuscripts, which could be kept as scrolls or loose sheets, or bound into codices. The European Renaissance pharmacopoeia borrows heavily from ancient sources, particularly Galen, Dioscorides, Theophrastus and Pliny the Elder.&nbsp; See separate page showing illustrations from <a target="_blank" href="manuscripts.html">ancient manuscripts</a>.</p>
<p align="left">Early handwritten herbals were often illustrated with paintings and drawings. Like other manuscript books, herbals were "published" through repeated copying by hand, either by professional scribes or by the readers themselves. In the process of making a copy, the copyist would often translate, expand, adapt, or reorder the content. Most of the original herbals have been lost; many have survived only as later copies (of copies of copies!), and many others are known only through references from other texts.&nbsp; They tend to follow the same pattern&nbsp; - the plant's physical appearance, smell, taste and natural habitat, followed by a discussion on any known medicinal qualities, culinary virtues, and then any useful products obtained from the plants roots, leaves, seeds or flowers. Sadly colour variations (of carrot) were rarely described until much later.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="herbals/grete1a.jpg" align="left" width="153" height="168" hspace="5" />The advent of printing in the 15th century and the technology of the woodblock print was to have an enormous influence in herbals. Printed herbals were in great demand by physicians, the apothecary, as well as for ordinary people who needed a source for remedies. Hand-illuminated manuscripts were too expensive to be owned by all except nobility or clergy in wealthy monasteries. Thus, the printed book became a source of information for the middle classes, while the focus of inquiry and new information came out of the burgeoning universities. In the 16th century, the age of exploration and the beginnings of scientific inquiry coupled with the tremendous interest in the new plants discovered in the "New Worlds" brought about an unprecedented demand for the printed herbal.</p>
<p align="left">In Europe, the first printed herbal with woodcut (xylograph) illustrations, the "Buch der Natur" of Konrad of Megenberg, appeared in 1475. Metal-engraved plates were first used in about 1580. The woodcuts and metal engravings could now be reproduced almost indefinitely, and they were traded among printers: there was therefore a large increase in the number of illustrations together with an improvement in their quality and detail. This is also why one scan often see the same illustration in different herbals.</p>
<hr color="#FFA500" />
<p align="left">Traditional Herbals are compilations of information about medicinal or therapeutic plants, typically including pla<a href="herbals/cruijdeboeck1.jpg"><img border="0" src="herbals/cruijdeboeck1asm.jpg" width="408" height="362" alt="Rembert Dodoens - Image of Yellow and Red Carrot 1554" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></a>nt names, descriptions, and illustrations, and information on medicinal uses. Herbals have been written for thousands of years and form an important historical record and scientific resource. Many plant medicines listed in older herbals are still used in some form, but some herbals, especially earlier ones, also contain much inaccurate information and plant lore.</p>
<p align="left">Herbals are a particularly interesting group in the history of written communication in that they have always been in circulation since the antiquities and were not 'rediscovered' during the renaissance.<br />
<br />
Despite the faithful transcription of the manuscript text by monastic scribes, distortions inevitably crept in as the work passed from one hand to the next. Greater variation exists among the illustrations which were often painted without reference to the living world. Regional variation in both plant types and knowledge as well as differences in editorial control also contributed over a thousand years of copying to a body of herbal manuscripts deriving from a few ancient sources.<br />
<br />
This all makes for a complex history but there are two lines or branches generally identified in classifying the lineage of a herbal. Perhaps the most important is the five volume pharmacopoeia/herbal, 'De Materia Medica' by Dioscorides from the first century AD, which represents the Greek/Arabic tradition. This work also supplies much of the textual origin for the other branch, the Latin tradition -&nbsp; which is contained within a corpus of works by an amalgamated author, referred to as Pseudo-Apuleius (sometimes called Apuleius Platonic, to distinguish him or them from a number of other authors from the middle ages called Apuleius). The original Pseudo-Apuleius Herbal was produced in about the 5th century AD.<br /></p>
<hr />
<p>For most of human history, people have relied on herbalism for at least some of their medicinal needs, and this remains true for more than half of the world's population in the twenty-first century. Much of our modern pharmacopoeia also has its roots in the historical knowledge of medicinal plants.</p>
<p>There is a very interesting presentation on line by the University of Minnesota Library entitled "Woodcut Herbals from 1491-1633" <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lib.umn.edu/botanical/herbalspresentation/herbals.php">here</a>.</p>
<p>European herbal medicine is rooted in the works of classical writers such as Pliny the Elder who wrote Historia Naturalis <a href="pliny.html">(here)</a>; and Dioscorides <a href="dioscorides.html">(here)</a>, a Greek physician and author of the first known illustrated guide to medicinal plants whose De Materia Medica (78 C. E.) formed the basis of herbals in Europe for 1,500 years and the most influential herbal of all time.</p>
<p>Then, as voyages of exploration began to bring new plants from far away lands, European herbal authors expanded their coverage. This also led to a heightened interest in naming and classifying plants, contributing to the development of botanical science.</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Also The Old English Herbarium (late10th C) takes its material from Pliny and other Latin compilations and cites uses for carrot:&nbsp;</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Arial"><i>"The pastinaca silvatica plant which is wild carrot or parsnip - For difficult childbirth and&nbsp; For womens cleansing -</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>82. Wild Carrot of Parsnip (Daucus carota L, or Pastinaca sativa L, pastinaca silvatica, Feldmoru.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>This plant which is called pastinace silvatice or wild carrots, grows in sandy soils and hills.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>1. If a woman has difficulty in giving birth, the plant we call pastinaca silvatica (wild carrot or parsnip), simmer it in water, and give it so that she can bathe herself with it. She will be healed.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>2. For a woman's cleansing, take the same plant, pastinaca, simmer it in water, and when it is soft, mix it well and give it to drink. She will be cleansed."</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="bald"></a>Leech Book of Bald</b> - The oldest surviving medical text book in England is also the oldest herbal, for of course herbs were medicine in the middle ages. This is the Leech Book of Bald, ( l�ce in Old English means healer) compiled in �lfred's time or very shortly thereafter by a monk named Bald, and penned, in its surviving copy, between 924 and 946 by a scribe (almost certainly also a monk) named Cild and possibly under the influence of Alfred the Great's educational reforms.</p>
<p>The Leechbook of Bald is an Old English medical text probably compiled in the tenth century.&nbsp; It takes its name from a Latin verse colophon at the end of the second book which begins "<i>Bald habet hunc librum Cild quem conscribere iussit</i>", meaning 'Bald owns this book which he ordered Cild to compile.' The text survives in only one manuscript in London at the British Library, Royal 12, D xvii.</p>
<p>Its wisdom formed the foundation of every succeeding English medical treatise. The Saxon herbal, the Leech Book of Bald, which dates from the first half of the 10th century, includes remedies and treatments and lots of superstition.&nbsp; It contains lots of herbal remedies, charms and incantations including many practices used by the Greeks and Romans.</p>
<p>The Leech Book of Bald reveals that herbs were used to protect people from infections. Bald remains a shadowy figure from the past and his writings suggest a time of superstition. It was believed disease occurred when people were struck with elves' arrows. Here are some extracts from this work:</p>

<hr />
<p><b>The 15th to the 17th centuries</b> were the great age of herbals, many of them available for the first time in English and other languages, rather than Latin or Greek.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1166 - Mattheau Platearius of Naples wrote <b>Circa Instans</b>&nbsp; a twelfth-century manuscript originating at Europe�s first medical school at Salerno, a loose translation of Dioscorides work describing 273 simple herbs used in the medical school in Salerno. Circa Instans is probably the most important work of botanical medicine of the Middle Ages as it contributed to a better understanding of unknown plants also identified each of them alphabetically showing geographical origin and variety, giving the names in Greek, Latin and often the vulgar too. The Circa Instans strongly influenced the Grand Herbier of Paris (1520) and was subsequently translated and printed into English as the Grete Herball in 1526</p>
<p>Although these early printed herbals undoubtedly revolutionised the dissemination of knowledge about medicinal plants, their illustrations were often crude and inaccurate, being based upon images repeatedly copied out from manuscripts from generation to generation, errors and all. They are of limited use for identification purposes and different plants were often depicted by repeated use of the same woodcuts, while the descriptions of the properties of the herbs tended to mix genuine Discoridean tradition with local folk lore and the pure imagination!.</p>
<p>The Sixteenth Century was the century of great herbals. The serious study of herbalism flourished as never before, resulting in the production of a plethora of works based upon field work and scientific fact.</p>
<hr color="#FFA500" />
<p align="left">Here are some of the references to the uses of carrots (wild and domesticated) in herbal works dating from the14th century.</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="left"><b><a name="daniel"></a>Henry Daniel</b> <font size="3">(1315 approx - 1385)&nbsp;was a</font>n English physician of the mid 14<sup>th</sup> century and a pioneer in the fields of botanical observation, ecology and the cultivation of exotic plants. <font size="3">&nbsp;Although little is known of Daniel's life, a good deal can be deduced from his surviving works, which include translations of medical treatises from the Latin and&nbsp;the extensive herbal</font> <b>De re Herbaria (1375)</b>. He must originally have been comparatively well-to-do, but later became poor and joined the Dominican Order.&nbsp; It was probably after entering religion that he was able to get access to the many authorities which he consulted in the compilation of his herbal.</p>
<p align="left">Friar Henry Daniel was an outstanding field naturalist, botanist and skilled gardener, who spent seven years training as a physician before becoming a Dominican Friar. He grew 252 plants in his garden at Stepney (London) and wrote many treatises on gardening and in particular herbs native to Britain, including detailed descriptions of soil and climates. Daniel was a scholar of distinction. He sought out works which, in many cases, must have been rare in English libraries, and his surviving translations are correct, clear, and forcibly expressed. His garden at Stepney may well have been the earliest deliberate collection planned on a large scale in the British Isles, and certainly contained many more species than would have been present in the herbarium of a monastic infirmary</p>
<p align="left">In the botanical habitats for plants named by Daniel were -&nbsp; <i><b>"Carrots</b> - growing in dry places, and in meers."</i></p>

<p><b><a name="cury"></a>The Forme Of Cury</b> -&nbsp; <b>1390</b> - A Roll of Ancient English Cookery. (printed and edited by Samuel Pegge in 1785, who deduced that Pasturnakes was taken to mean Parsnips or Carrots, from Pastinaca.)&nbsp; (Cury means cookery)</p>
<p>Compiled, by the Master-Cooks of King RICHARD II, Presented afterwards to Queen ELIZABETH, by EDWARD Lord STAFFORD.</p>
<p>Two recipes containing "Pasturnakes" are given in this very early work.</p>
<blockquote><i>"RAPES [1] IN POTAGE. V.</i>
<p><i>Take rapus and make hem clene and waissh hem clene. quare hem . parboile hem. take hem up. cast hem in a gode broth and see hem. mynce Oynouns and cast erto Safroun and salt and messe it forth with powdour douce. the wise [3] make of Pasturnakes&nbsp; and skyrwates.</i></p>

<p><b><a name="hortus"></a>The <i>Hortus Sanitatis</i> 1491</b> or the <i>Ortus Sanitatis</i> (the origin of health), as it is also known, is in the tradition of the medieval herbals and shows one of the earliest illustrations of the Carrot (shown right).</p>
<p>It is partly based on <i>Der Gart der Gesundheit</i> (Garden of Health), which is sometimes attributed to Johann von Cube, and was originally printed by Peter Schoeffer at Mainz in 1485. However, it should be regarded as a separate work as it covered nearly a hundred more medicinal plants than the <i>Gart der Gesundheit</i> and also included extensive sections on animals, birds, fish and minerals, as well as a treatise on urine. The authorship of this lavishly illustrated herbal is unknown but it is generally believed to have been compiled by its printer, Jacob Meydenbach. It was first printed in&nbsp; in Mainz and is therefore the last major medical work to cover medicines from the Old World only.</p>
<p><b><a name="grete"></a>Grete Herbal 1526 -</b> One of the most reputed English Herbals,&nbsp; it was nevertheless a translation from the French, namely from the work known as ' Le Grant Herbier,' and shows some indebtedness to the Ortus Sanitatis. Other sources say it is derived from the Codex Bruxellensis iv MS 1024 and became the basis of all English herbals of the 16th century.&nbsp;&nbsp; Daucus Cretensis (wild carrot) is depicted in a drawing in the original manuscript.

In fact, Fuchs work was greatly inspired by the Herbarum vivae icones(1530-6) of Brunfels; based upon personal observation, Brunfels work was pioneering in dramatically changing the quality of botanical illustration.&nbsp;Fuchs' great herbal, however, was conceived on a much larger scale than the herb books of his immediate predecessors.</p>
<p align="left"><span class="large-ltgray">Like most botanical books of its time, �Fuchs� Herbal� (as it is commonly known) consists largely</span> <span class="large-ltgray">of �commentaries� on Dioscorides.</span> His aim was to reproduce each plant from life, and he stated in his dedicatory epistle that this was done for no other reason than that 'a picture expresses things more surely and fixes them more deeply in the mind than the bare words of the text'. Each illustration was therefore based upon the appearance of the living plant; furthermore, 'we have not allowed the craftsmen so to indulge their whims as to cause the drawing not to correspond accurately to the truth'.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Fuchs in 1542 described, in Latin, red and yellow garden carrots and wild carrots, but names them all <i>Pastinaca.</i> Fuchs illustrates red and yellow carrots, although the red is definitely shaded towards purple.</p>

<p align="left"><b><a name="turner"></a>William Turner 1548&nbsp;</b> set out to produce reliable lists of English plants and animals, which he published as <i>Libellus de re herbaria.</i></p>
<p align="left">Clergyman, physician, and naturalist, born in Morpeth, Northumberland, NE England, UK. A fellow of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, he became a Protestant, and to escape religious persecution in England travelled extensively abroad, studying medicine and botany in Italy. He is the author of the first original English works on plants, including Names of Herbes (1548) and A New Herball (155168), He is often called the father of English botany.<b><br />
<br /></b>In the Names of Herbes (1548 - An index of English names, and an identification of the plants enumerated) Turner made the following entries:</p>
<blockquote><i>"<b>Daucus</b>.<br />
There are many kyndes of Daucus after Dioscorides, three at the least, wherof I knowe none suerly but one, whiche is called in latin pastinaca syluestris, in english wild carot &amp; in greeke Staphilinos agrios, for the other kindes ye may use carawey seede, or carot seede. Some learned me not without a cause hold that both the Saxifrages, that is the englishe, and the Italion may be occupied for Dauco. Daucus is sharpe and heateth."</i>
<p align="left"><i><b>Pastinaca</b>.<br />
Pastinaca is called in greeke Staphilinos in englishe a Carot, in duche pasteney, in frenche Cariottes. Carettes growe in al countreis in plentie."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">A New Herball, (1551) is the first part of Turner's great work; These volumes gave the first clear, systematic survey of English plants, and with their admirable woodcuts (mainly copied from Fuchs' 1542 De historia Stirpium) and detailed observations based on Turner's own field studies put the herbal on an altogether higher footing than in earlier works. At the same time, however, Turner included an account of their "uses and vertues," and in his preface admits that some will accuse him of divulging to the general public what should have been reserved for a professional audience.</p>
<p align="left">Turner considered the <i>Grete Herball</i> (above) to be "al full of unlearned cacographes and falseye naminge of herbes". This was because the Herball was a translation of of French Herbal (Le grant herbier) which in turn was a part reflex of a Latin Work (Circa instans) leading to discrepancies in the correct naming of plants.</p>

This herbal, or historie of plants was subtitled "Wherein is contained the whole discourse and perfect description of all sorts of herbs and plants."&nbsp; Written in old English, it is a fascinating summary of the carrot at the time in England. Basically an English copy of Dodoens earlier work.</p>
<p align="left">He did not perhaps add very greatly to the knowledge of English botany, but he did a valuable service in introducing Dodoens' herbal into England. He said the root of the garden carrots (compared to wild) is more convenient and better to be eaten.</p>

<blockquote>The title of Lyte's book is as follows: <i>'A Niewe Herball or Historie of Plantes : wherin is contayned the whole discourse and perfect description of all sortes of Herbes and Plantes : their divers and sundry kindes : their straunge Figures, Fashions, and Shapes : their Names, Natures, Operations, and Vertues : and that not onely of those which are here growyng in this our Countrie of Englande, but of all others also of forrayne Realmes, commonly used in Physicke.

It is also a preservative against all diseases for it provoketh sweat by which the body is purged of much corruption which breedeth disease."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Carrots</b> - It is excellent for the head, and the parts thereof; this herb being eat, or the powder or juice drank, keepeth a person from the head ach and megrum, and also driveth it away. Being taken in meat of drink, it is good against dizziness and swimming giddiness of the head. It comforteth the brain, sharpeneth the wit, and strengthen the memory; it is a singular&nbsp; remedy against deafness, for it amendeth the thickness of the hearing, and provoketh sleep.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>The juice of it laid to the eyes, quickeneth the sight, also the water in which the powder, or herb dried, is steeped, hath the same effect if the eyes be washed therewith; the herb eaten, is good for the same purpose. the water or juice dropped into the eyes, cureth the redness, bloodshotten, and itching of them.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Some write that is strengthens the teeth, there being washed and rubbed with a cloth dipped in water of juice thereof. The powder stauncheth the blood that floweth out of the nose, being applied to the place. I comforteth the stomach; the broth of the herb, otherwise called the decoction drank in wine, is good for an evil stomach; it helpeth a weak stomach and causeth appetite to meat; also the wine wherein it has been boiled, doth cleanse and mundify the infected stomach.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>The powder&nbsp; thereof eaten with honey, or drank in wine, doth ripen and digest cold phlegm, purgeth and bringeth up that which is in the breast, scouring the same of gross humours, and causeth to breathe more easily. The herb chewed in the mouth, healeth the stench of breath. It helpeth the heart; the powder being taken before a man is infected, preserveth him from the pestilence; and a dram of it, or a walnut shell full, taken immediately after he feeleth infected, expelleth the venom of the pestilent infection from the heart, for if that man sweateth afterwards, he may be preserved; the same effect hath the herb boiled in wine, or in the urine of a health man child, drank; I mean the decoction or liquor from the which the herb is strained, after that it hath been boiled therein."</i></p>

An extract from the work is given <a href="lovell1665.pdf">here (pdf).</a></p>
<p align="left"><i>"The carrot is red and yellow. The root of the yellow is temperately hot and something moist, of little nourishment, and that not very good, it's not so windie as the turnep, nor passeth so soon through the belly. The red is of like faculty, the seed of both is hot and dry. The seed breaketh and consumeth windiness and provoketh urine, as that of the wild carrots. The root is usually boyled with fat flesh and eaten."</i></p>
<p align="left"><b><a name="billing"></a>Robert Billing, Farmer, An Account of the Culture of Carrots</b> and their in feeding and fattening cattle, November 1764. This document gives a detailed description of experiments in farming techniques (sowing, soil, harvesting, timing) to find the ideal carrots to feed to cattle. A fascinating insight into farming in the 18th century.&nbsp; He organised 24 and a half acres to the production of carrots in 1764. He describes the earth a loamy brick with cold sand and a touch gravely!</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left"><i>"I have found the best method of drawing carrots to be a four tined fork with which a man breaks the ground, six or eight inches deep very carefully without injuring the carrot; and is followed by a little boy who gathers the carrots and throws them in heaps."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"I gave sixteen horses two loads of carrots every week, and these two loads, I compute saved me more than a load of hay; this saving was for 28 weeks so it saved me 28 loads of hay which at 25 shillings a load, saved me �35. To this I might add the benefit received by the swine to whom I threw all the tops and tails of the carrots fed to the horses, and they throve exceedingly and they were so fond o them I could never find and dirt that might stick to them."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>He concludes: " Thus I have a given a material and exact account of every material circumstance that has occurred to me in the culture and use of carrots; for the feeding of cattle. I am sensible than more extraordinary, and I have been careful to avoid exaggeration. The large amount of carrots I have grown in this year have given me the opportunity of judging fully and without any danger of considerable fallacy, what may be expected from the common use of carrots in feeding every species of cattle on them."</i></p>

<p align="left">The document goes on to tell us that it was witnessed as a true account by John Franklin, Vicar.</p>
<p align="left"><b><a name="philips"></a>Henry Phillips - History of cultivated vegetables</b> 1822&nbsp;&nbsp; (<a target="_blank" href="histveg.pdf">pdf extract here</a>) gives an excellent summary of the history of carrots as known at the time, reviewing what the Greeks and Romans said, then commenting on the contribution of the herbalists to the knowledge of carrot and its medicinal uses, in particular Gerard and Parkinson.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"><i>"The ancients used the seed both of the wild and the cultivated carrot, as an internal medicine against the bite of serpents ; they also gave it to animals that had been stung by them ; a dram weight in wine was thought a sufficient dose.</i></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><i>The roots of the garden carrots are now much used as a poultice for running cancers, etc.&nbsp; Sugar is found in this root, but in less quantities than in the parsnip, or the beet. A very good spirit may be distilled from carrots. An acre of these roots, allowing the produce to be twenty tons, will produce 240 gallons of spirits, which is considerably more than can be obtained from five quarters of barley.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Dr. James says, carrots are one of the most considerable culinary roots ; that they strengthen and fatten the body, and are a very proper food for consumptive persons. They are somewhat flatulent, but are thought to render the body soluble, and to contribute to the cure of a cough.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Carrots are generally served to table with boiled meats : they make an excellent soup, and form an agreeable pudding. In some parts of the country they are sent to table with fish of every description.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Helmont informs us, that he knew a gentleman who was seized with a fit of the stone every fifteen days, freed from the attacks of his disorder for several years, by means of an infusion of carrot-seed in clear malt liquor. An infusion of them in white wine is excellent in hysterical complaints."</i></p>

<p align="left"><i>"Parts Used Medicinally---The whole herb, collected in July; the seeds and root. The whole herb is the part now more generally in use.</i></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><i>---Medicinal Action and Uses---Diuretic, Stimulant, Deobstruent. An infusion of the whole herb is considered an active and valuable remedy in the treatment of dropsy, chronic kidney diseases and affections of the bladder. The infusion of tea, made from one ounce of the herb in a pint of boiling water, is taken in wineglassful doses. Carrot tea, taken night and morning, and brewed in this manner from the whole plant, is considered excellent for lithic acid or gouty disposition. A strong decoction is very useful in gravel and stone, and is good against flatulence. A fluid extract is also prepared, the dose being from 1/2 to 1 drachm.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>The seeds are carminative, stimulant and very useful in flatulence, windy colic, hiccough, dysentery, chronic coughs, etc. The dose of the seeds, bruised, is from one-third to one teaspoonful, repeated as necessary. They were at one time considered a valuable remedy for calculus complaints. They are excellent in obstructions of the viscera, in jaundice (for which they were formerly considered a specific), and in the beginnings of dropsies, and are also of service as an emmenagogue. They have a slight aromatic smell and a warm, pungent taste. They communicate an agreeable flavour to malt liquor, if infused in it while in the vat, and render it a useful drink in scorbutic disorders.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Old writers tell us that a poultice made of the roots has been found to mitigate the pain of cancerous ulcers, and that the leaves, applied with honey, cleanse running sores and ulcers. An infusion of the root was also used as an aperient."</i></p>
