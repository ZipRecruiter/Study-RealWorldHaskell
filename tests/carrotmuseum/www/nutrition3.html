Herbs do not heal, they feed. Herbs do not force the body to maintain and repair itself. They simply support the body in these natural functions.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Carrots are credited with many medicinal properties; they are said to cleanse the intestines and <img src="gifs/3type.gif" width="205" height="178" align="right" />to be diuretic, remineralizing, antidiarrheal, an overall tonic and antianemic. Carrot is rich in alkaline elements which purify and revitalize the blood. They nourish the entire system and help in the maintenance of acid-alkaline balance in the body. The carrot also has a reputation as a vegetable that helps to maintain good eyesight.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Raw grated carrot can be applied as a compress to burns for a soothing effect. Its highly energizing juice has a particularly beneficial effect on the liver. Consumed in excessive quantities, carrots can cause the skin to turn yellow; this phenomenon, which is called Carotenemia and caused by the carotene contained in carrots, is frequently seen in young children but is not at all dangerous.<br />
See "do not overdose" <i>below</i> or <a href="nutrition.html#overdose">click here</a>.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">An infusion of carrot seeds (1 teaspoon per cup of boiling water) is believed to be diuretic, to stimulate the appetite, reduce colic, aid fluid retention and help alleviate menstrual cramps. The dried flowers are also used as a tea as a remedy for dropsy. Taken in wine, or boiled in wine and taken, the seeds help conception. Strangely enough the seeds made into a tea have been used for centuries as a contraceptive. Applied with honey, the leaves cleanse running sores or ulcers. Carrots are also supposed to help break wind and remove stitches in the side. Chewing a carrot immediately after food kills all the harmful germs in the mouth. It cleans the teeth, removes the food particles lodged in the crevices and prevents bleeding of the gums and tooth decay. Carrot soup is supposed to relieve diarrhoea and help with tonsillitis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In days gone by they grated raw carrot and gave it to children to expel worms. Pulped carrot is used as a cataplasm for application to ulcers and sores. They were also supposed to improve your memory abilities and relieve nervous tension. An Old English superstition is that the small purple flower in the centre of the Wild Carrot (Queen Annes Lace)&nbsp;was of benefit in curing epilepsy. <i>Visit the Wild Carrot page.</i> <a href="queen.html">Click here.</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Queen Annes Lace (the Wild Carrot) was also considered toxic. The leaves contain furocoumarins that may cause allergic contact dermatitis from the leaves, especially when wet. Later exposure to the sun may cause mild photodermatitis. Wild Carrot seed is also an early abortifacient, historically, sometimes used as a natural "morning after" contraceptive tea. Queen Annes Lace has long been used because of its contraceptive properties.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img src="gifs/2prong.gif" width="60" height="59" align="right" alt="twin carrot" />It has since been scientifically proven that the carrot seed extract, if given orally at the correct dosage from day 4 to 6 post-coitum, effectively inhibits implantation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF0000">Pliny the Elder</font> suggested that it was used as a love potion, guaranteed to be effective, and Galen goes so far as to claim that it actually "procures lust." As a vegetable, however, the carrot in Roman times remained a bitter, tough taproot, edible only in the early spring as a pot herb.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">As the carrot was improved it found its way into medicine chests as well as stew pots. Both <font color="#FF0000">Gerard and Culpeper</font> recommend the carrot for numerous ills. Culpeper says that the carrot is influenced by Mercury, the god of wind, and that a tea made from the dried leaves should dispel wind from the bowels and relieve dropsy, kidney stones, and women's complaints.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Experimentally hypoglycemic, a tea made from Queen Annes Lace was believed to help maintain low blood sugar levels in humans, but it had no effect on diabetes artificially induced in animals. Wild carrot tea has been recommended for bladder and kidney ailment, dropsy, gout, gravel; seeds are recommended for calculus, obstructions of the viscera <i>(internal organs)</i>, dropsy, jaundice, scurvy. Carrots of one form or another were once served at every meal for liver derangements; now we learn that they may upset the liver.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Medicinally the Carrot was used as a diuretic, stimulant, in the treatment of dropsy, flatulence, chronic coughs, dysentery, windy colic, chronic renal diseases and a host of other uses.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Eating carrots is also good for allergies, aneamia, rheumatism, tonic for the nervous system. Everyo<img border="0" src="photos/crown1.JPG" alt="carrot crown" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="302" height="249" />ne knows they can improve eye health; But it does not stop there the delicious carrot is good for diarrhoea, constipation (very high in fibre), intestinal inflammation, cleansing the blood (a liver tonic), an immune system tonic. Carrot is traditionally recommended to weak, sickly or rickety children, to convalescents or pregnant women, its anti-aneamic properties having been famous for a long time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Tea made the seeds can promote the onset of menstruation. It is effective on skin problems including broken veins/capillaries, burns, creeping impetigo, wrinkles and sun damage. Carrots also help in stimulating milk flow during lactation. Believe it or not the carrot is also effective against roundworms and dandruff. Pureed carrots are good for babies with diarrhoea, providing essential nutrients and natural sugars.</font></p>

Cooked carrots are rated at 49 in the Glycaemic Index, the scale invented to help in the treatment of diabetes, and which is used to measure the rate at which blood sugar levels rise when a particular carbohydrate bearing food is ingested. Lower level GI foods, (those below 50 are seen as best), are more complex and hence digested more slowly, ensuring a longer feeling of satiety, longer term energy maintenance and keeping blood sugar levels constant.</font></p>
<p align="left"><b>Did you know?</b> - One pound of carrots gives a normal man enough energy to raise 64 tons 1 foot in the air?&nbsp; That same pound can produce 1 ounce and 11 grains of sugar.&nbsp;&nbsp; A pound also contains 14 ounces of water.</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial"><a name="doctrine"></a>Doctrine of Signatures -</font> THE DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURES is an ancient principle found in many cultures, east and west. Like homeopathy, the Doctrine of Signatures rests on the belief that all living things are inter connected<img src="gifs/carrots-a.gif" width="40" height="40" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="4" /> by an energetic force: called 'chi' in oriental medicine, 'prana' in Indian philosophy, the vital force, or quantum energy in other cultures. It can go by many names.</p>
<p>The awesome insight of civilizations past has since been somewhat corroborated by today�s exploratory nutritional sciences:<br />
<br />
<img src="photos/bohme.jpg" width="81" height="105" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" />In simple terms, the "Doctrine of Signatures" is the idea that God has marked everything He created with a sign (signature). The sign was an indication of the purpose for the creation of the item. The "Doctrine of Signatures" was popularised in the early 1600s by the writings of Jakob B�hme (1575-1624), a master shoemaker in the small town of G�rlitz, Germany. At the age of 25, B�hme had a profound mystical vision in which he saw the relationship between God and man. As a result of the vision, he wrote "Signatura Rerum; The Signature of all Things".</p>
<p align="left">His book espoused a spiritual philosophy; however it soon was adopted for its medical application. The Doctrine states that, by observation, one can determine from the colour of the flowers or roots, the shape of the leaves, the place of growing, or other signatures, what the plant's purpose was in God's plan<br />
<br />
<img src="gifs/Paracelsus.gif" width="148" height="171" align="left" />Paracelsus, a physician, mystic and alchemist in the sixteenth century was a famous proponent of the Doctrine of Signatures. He, like others of his time, believed that the microcosm (man) was a reflection of the macrocosm (the universe): as above, so below; as without, so within. This meant that each person was a reflection of everything external including the stars and the planets. Any imbalance in man (manifesting as disease symptoms) would have to be corrected by a substance or element in nature, balancing the universe within the man. &nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Paraclesus used the Doctrine of Signature to understand the healing properties of plants. This method of understanding the healing properties of the plant is based on the plants distinct characteristics such as growth, colour, shape, scent, or taste.<br />
<br />
The Doctrine of Signatures was highly developed during the European Renaissance. This interest paralleled the widespread belief in an overall unity of Nature<br />
<br />
The word "signature" is a duplet, or two-part word derived from the two words "sign" and "nature", or Signs of Nature. Ancient p<img src="photos/orangec.jpg" width="125" height="125" align="right" alt="Orange carrot slice" />eople saw patterns in certain whole foods that resembled parts of the human body and used them to choose specific foods for specific health.</p>
<p>For example, <b>a sliced carrot</b> . That is the "signature" of a carrot. The ancients equated that to mean that carrots are good for the eyes. Recent research has confirmed this scientifically.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in the 18th century people ate orange carrots to cure icterus (jaundice) because of the colour of its root. Icterus causes a yellowing of the white of the eye.</p>
<p>The section of a Carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) with its radiating lines looks like the pupil and iris of the human eye and these massively improve blood flow to the eyes and assist in the general function of the eyes. Carrots get their orange colour from a plant chemical known as beta-carotene, which reduces the risk of developing cataracts. The chemical also protects sight problems that that develop over the age of sixty five.</p>
<p>Jaundice is often seen in liver disease such as hepatitis or liver cancer. It may also indicate leptospirosis or obstruction of the biliary tract, for example by gallstones or pancreatic cancer, or less commonly be congenital in origin (e.g., biliary atresia). Yellow discoloration of the skin, especially on the palms and the soles, but not of the sclera and mucous membranes (i.e. oral cavity) is due to carotenemia�a harmless condition important to differentiate from jaundice.</p>
<p align="left">Another example is the walnut. If you open a walnut shell, the nourishing nut inside appears to resemble the human brain with its left and right hemispheres, lobes, and cerebral cortex. So the walnut's "signature" is the brain. Recent science again confirms that the fleshy food of walnuts contains omega 3 and 5 fatty acids which cross the blood-brain barrier and are necessary for the production of the pre-cursor of neurotransmitters in the brain. There are many other whole foods with signatures recognized by the wisdom of the ancients. Other examples of foods with signatures include kidney beans for the kidneys, avocados for the female cervix/womb, tomatoes for the heart and blood and so on.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Conclusion:</b> Concepts similar to the Doctrine of Signatures may be found in folk or indigenous medicines and in modern alternative medicines. The signatures are described as post hoc attributions and mnemonics [24] of value only in creating a system for remembering actions attributed to medical herbs. However, till now there is no scientific evidence that shapes and colours help in the discovery of medical uses of plants or animals. The Doctrine of Signatures may sound eccentric to us but its insight is primeval and rediscovered in contemporary times.</p>

Yin, or cooling, foods are said to have a calming effect, whereas yang foods are warming. Neutral foods, such as rice and other whole grains, provide balance. Westerners tend to over indulge in yang foods, such as french fries and meat. The aim is to maintain health through a proper balance of yin and yang.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Yin (cooling) foods include Steamed, poached, or boiled foods. Bok choy, bean sprouts, cucumber, eggplant, tofu, seafood.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Yang (warming) foods include Deep fried, stir-fried, or roasted foods. Meats &amp; poultry. Garlic, ginger, spices, <font color="#FF0000">carrots</font>, onion.</font></p>

Many food colours are being banned by Governments of several countries. Food colours are only a matter of choice. Colour is added to food to improve the appearance, delight the on-looker and deceive the senses. But the colour itself does not alter the nutritive value or taste in any way. Carrots, saffron, turmeric, cocoa, caramel, annatto, etc., are all food colouring agents obtained from natural sources. They generally contain lignans, carotene, quercetin, flavonoids and isoflavanoids, which are known to have a profound preventive effect on certain types of cancer. It is possible to extract natural colours from coloured fruits and vegetables and use them to colour other foods. For example, pink and orange colour can be extracted from beetroot and carrot and used to colour sweets.<br />
<br />
Chromotherapy is a method of treatment of diseases by colour. It is best used as a supportive therapy along with other natural methods of preserving health such as correct diet, adequate rest and relaxation, exercise, yogic asanas and so on.<br />
<br />
According to practitioners of chromotherapy, the cause of any disease can be traced to the lack of a particular colour in the human system. Colour therapy is a technique of restoring imbalance by means of applying coloured light to the body. It was a popular method of cure even in ancient times. Some 2,500 years ago, Pythagoras applied colour light therapeutically and 'colour halls' were used for healing in ancient Egypt, China and India.<br />

The orange Carrot colour is symbolic of prosperity and pride, and is useful for stimulating blood supply and energising the nerves. It is beneficial in the treatment of kidney and gall stones, hernia and appendicitis. It is also used to stimulate the milk producing action of breasts after childbirth.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="folklore"></a>Follklore</b></p>
<p>Folklore on uses of plants for their magical curative powers can be organized in various ways-the transference of the ailment to another object, the method of collection, the place and time of use, planting and collecting ritual, etc.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The umbels give us many examples of such folklore. Umbels have been used for improving the eyesight <i>(health)</i>, healing or assuaging earache and toothache, as a diuretic, a diaphoretic, emmenagogue, purgative, emetic, for cure of venereal diseases, nervous conditions, as contraceptives, as poultices for wounds, bites, swellings, etc. Many genera, such as carrot and celery, were considered panacea <i>(cure-alls)</i>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carrots were particularly important.</b></p>
<p>Galen, the Roman physician around 200AD, said of the wild carrot (Daucus carota L.) "it contained in it a certain force to procure lust."&nbsp; Pliny, Roman naturalist around 50AD quoted Orpheus as saying it "winneth love." (Leighton 1986).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Eating raw carrots or drinking the juice to cure jaundice (probably because of the yellow colour) was recommended (Foster 1953; Grieve 1971; Hand 1980; Neal 1955; Roy 1962; Wintemberg 1950).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hollowing out or cutting holes in the carrot root, adding water or urine from the patient, and hanging the carrot near the fire or in a chimney to dry cured jaundice as it dried (Bouteiller 1966; Cizmir 1946; Fogel 1915; Hoffman-Krayer and Bachtold-Stiiubel 1927; Hovorka and Kronfeld 1908; Hyatt 1965; Lick and Brendle 1923; Hand, Casetta and Thiederman 1981; Wuttke 1900).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An easier disposition was to hang the carrot in the basement (Hand and Talley 1984). To stop bed wetting a hollowed out carrot was filled with the child's urine and hung in the chimney to dry (Hand, Casetta and Thiederman 1981).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To cure diphtheria the sick person was to urinate on a cup of carrot greens which were then hung in the northwest part of the chimney for eight days (Anderson 1970).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In Illinois a doctor was reported to say that spasms were always caused by a worm in a child's neck and he recommended giving the child carrot juice which worms did not like and they would crawl out of the neck (Hyatt 1965)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cures for warts are often magical. A Virginia remedy was "Take the thick or top part of a red common carrot, cut out the inside core, and fill up the hole with common table salt. The moisture of the carrot dissolves the salt." This solution was applied to the wart with the finger two or three times a day (Harris 1968). It was also said that a wart would go away if you rubbed it with a carrot, buried the carrot, and forgot the place where it was buried, or bit the end off the carrot each time after rubbing it on the wart (Hand and Talley 1984)</p>
