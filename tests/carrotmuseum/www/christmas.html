<p>In Eastern Europe and in the US, people hang glass carrot baubles on their trees. Carrots have long held a special place in German legend. The glass carrot ornament is truly a decoration that can bring a tear to an old woman's eye. Long ago the glass carrot was very popular in Germany as a traditional gift for brides bringing<img border="0" src="xmastree5black.gif" align="right" width="113" height="129" /> them good luck in the kitchen! After being lost for many years, the antique mould has resurfaced and German artisans are again creating this treasure for a bride's first Christmas tree.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">What is Boxing day?</font> - In most English speaking countries (except the US!), the day following Christmas day is called Boxing Day. This phrase comes from the custom which started in the Middle Ages around 800 years ago. Churches would open their "alms boxe" (boxes in which people placed gifts of money) and distribute the contents to poor people in the neighbourhood on the day after Christmas. The tradition continues today - small gifts are often given to delivery workers such as postal staff and children who deliver newspapers.</p>

<p>How to Eat Like a King for Christmas in 1660. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/How-to-Eat-Like-a-King-for-Christmas.html">Here</a></p>
<hr color="#FF9900" size="3" />
<p><b><a name="ww2"></a>A commentary on how UK citizens fed themselves in WW2 at Christmas time</b></p>
<p>Carrots and potatoes and even gravy browning were key ingredients in wartime recipes for Christmas pudding. When people couldn't get turkey, they had "murkey" instead.</p>
<p>The shortages and rationing during World War II, which persisted for years afterwards, meant that households had to be imaginative and resourceful in the kitchen. For today's families, there's the choice of luxury supermarket puddings or home-made versions which can be packed full of dried fruit and nuts, with plenty of sugar, treacle, eggs and sweet spices. Sadly due to blockades of shipping, in wartime most of these ingredients were in short supply.</p>
<p>Canny cooks preparing for Christmas would start early, saving dried fruit from their rations throughout the year. But sometimes there just was not enough and the wartime spirit of "make do and mend" found its way into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Christmas pudding had less fruit, no eggs and could sometimes contain potatoes and gravy browning. They did their best to make it special, even in 1943 and 1944, when shortages made life particularly grim.</p>
<p>Christmas cake was made without eggs and with less flour, less fruit and less fat than its modern equivalent. The marzipan was a mix of semolina, sugar, water and flavouring.</p>
<p>Carrots and potatoes were added to Christmas pudding, mainly to add moisture, but they also added sweetness and texture. Wartime food shortages forced people to adopt new eating patterns. Sweet root vegetables added to Christmas cake could include beetroot, parsnips and turnips.</p>
<p>Turkey was often very difficult to get, so housewives were advised to cook "murkey", which was stuffed mutton. The stuffing was largely made of breadcrumbs. No one threw away a stale loaf in those days. The word murkey was coined by cockney comedians Elsie and Doris Waters, whose alter egos, Gert and Daisy, were stars of the BBC radio programme The Kitchen Front. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/history4.html">(read more about carrots in WW2 here)</a></p>
<p>The programme came on every weekday after the 8am news and was full of household tips and suggestions of how to make food go further.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Food used the radio extensively to push out the messages they wanted to get across. There was a glut of carrots so they invented Dr Carrot, and featured it in broadcasts, almost weekly. An earlier attempt to popularise mutton was a bacon substitute called 'macon' which appeared in 1940 just as rationing came into force.</p>
<p>For most people today, including gravy browning in a cake would be a step too far - but there were plenty of less extreme examples. The 1940s cook prepared everything from scratch and made more use of seasonal food. For example they might use raw in-season vegetables like beetroot, carrots, cabbage and even parsnips and turnips in salads if there were no conventional salad vegetables available.</p>
<p>The diet was actually healthy as well as being economical as food shortages forced people to adopt new eating patterns. Most people ate less meat, fat, eggs and sugar than they had eaten before, but also, people who had previously consumed a poor diet were able to increase their intake of protein and vitamins because they received the same ration as everyone else.</p>
<p>Many people ate a better diet during rationing than before the war years and this had a marked effect on the health of the population - infant mortality declined and life expectancy increased.</p>
<p>Modern households have much to learn from the frugality and creativity of the 1940s cook.&nbsp; <a href="xmas2018.html">Carrot Museum Christmas page here</a>.</p>
