Smith lands the pod on a planet where plants are the highest form of intelligence next to the writer of this episode. The Robinsons lands only to be captured by Tybo a giant carrot. He plans to turn them into trees while Dr. Smith becomes a stalk of celery.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">In this classic episode (season 3 episode 23, 28 February 1968) Dr. Smith is attacked by a giant carrot. Millions of American children feared carrots after this episode was broadcast...and also ran around the house waving their arms shouting "Moisture! Moisture! I need moisture!" whenever they were thirsty!&nbsp; - (from the episode The Great Vegetable Rebellion - On another planet) Dr. Smith plucks a flower, arousing accusations of murder from a giant, talking carrot, who plans to punish the Robinsons by turning them into plants.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">Tybo - An intelligent carrot creature (played by Stanley Adams) who accused Dr. Smith (Jonathan Harris) of murdering plants when he picked some flowers for the robot's birthday celebration on the February 28, 1968 episode "The Great Vegetable Rebellion" on the sci-fi adventure Lost In Space(CBS/1965-68).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">For his actions, Tybo sentences Dr. Smith to be turned into a plant. Shades of celery stalks! Then Tybo imprisons the other members of the Robinson family space expedition inside a greenhouse force field in preparation for their own flora and fauna transmutation.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin-top: 5.25pt"><font face="Arial">Of course, everybody escapes the hothouse. In the end, John Robinson (Guy Williams) offers Tybo some water to drink, thus calling a truce of sorts between the animal and vegetable kingdom.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin-top: 5.25pt"><font face="Arial">Trivia note: In 1997, TV Guide named "The Great Vegetable Rebellion" episode (written by Peter Packer) one of the greatest TV episodes of all times. The episode brought awareness that all living things feel pain and that maybe we should be a bit more open-minded to the issues of other species. Stanley Adams who played Tybo is also remembered for his role as a swindling space trader ("Wanna buy a Tribble?") in the classic Star Trek episode "Trouble with Tribbles."</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Movie School for Secrets 1946</b> - During World War II, on the eve of the Battle of Britain, British scientists develop the first radar systems to be employed against the German Luftwaffe. Directed by Peter Ustinov.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">School for Secrets tells the story of the "boffins" - research scientists - who discovered and developed radar and helped avoid the German invasion of Britain in 1940. Five scientists, led by Professor Heatherville (Ralph Richardson), are brought together to work in secrecy and under pressure to develop the device. Their dedication disrupts their family lives as they are forced to sacrifice everything to make a breakthrough. Their success is illustrated by the effect radar has on the fighting abilities of the RAF over the skies of Britain in the summer and autumn months of 1940. However, Germany is also planning its own radar capability and British commandos are dispatched to strike a German installation. The scientists complete their work just in time for the Battle of Britain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;In a conversation between the chief pilot and the �boffins�&nbsp; - We need to keep this invention secret so we have to put out some misinformation about <b>eating a diet with a high concentration of carrots</b>, to aid the night vision of the pilots.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><b><font color="#FF0000">Poil de Carotte (Carrot Head) 1932 - a French Film</font><br /></b> <b><br /></b></font> The absolute worst sub-titles notwithstanding, this is a great film because visually the story is clearly told (it is a remake of a silent picture by the same director). And because there is the sweetest pastorale quality about the filming of this picture, like Babe, the pig who-would-be sheepdog. The adult actors deliver an inspired reading; trained in classical theater they were also successful on the stage at the time. The boy who plays Carrot-top (or Carrot-head if you prefer) was discovered walking on the Champs-Elys�e. Harry Baur, Catherine Fonteney, and Robert Lynen are superb in the story of a boy devastated by an abusive mother and a distant father. The film shows the fragile, yet resilient childhood world of the boy by employing numerous and ingenious imagery suggesting dreams and fear of the dark.</p>

<p>Would you pray to a purple carrot? In an Opera? - Tribute to Jos� Luis Cuerda and his pumpkin.</p>
<p>Inside the opera LA STRAORDINARIA VITA DI SUGAR BLOOD with the Chorus Vivaldi and Ricardo Estrada</p>
<p>Rough translation of the song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh purple carrot good morning dawn. I bow before you to thank you. From the heart I thank you as I do every day because you whose lineage is served in the banquets of the rich and powerful have preferred the humble pot of a poor old man to set an example to the world.</p>
<p>I thank you from the heart like every day because when the discouragement &nbsp;and bitterness take me down, you listen to me, bewitched and guide my way. Carrot you are beautiful, beautiful and new in your old purple dress. Stay with us dear carrot forever. I carry you in the Heart.</p>
