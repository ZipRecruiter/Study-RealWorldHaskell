As far as the Carrot Museum is aware no Government agency has banned their consumption or issued warnings of any hazards.</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Carrot greens are the most under-exploited class of greens despite their high nutritional value. In any daily diet an increased intake of these inexpensive greens can be one of the strategies for improving the nutritional status.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">There is some debate about whether you can eat the green leaves. In the past, there was widespread belief that these greens were toxic, but this is likely due to their bitter flavour. Humans tend to associate bitterness with toxicity, but as it turns out, these greens are edible and do not pose a threat to health. Due to their bitterness, however, they are rarely considered for consumption.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>Yes you can!</b> Despite the presence of celery and carrots in the carrot family of Apiaceae ("umbellifers"), many other members of the family are highly poisonous, but not carrot. They ARE edible and are highly nutritive, rich in protein, minerals and vitamins. The tops of the carrots are loaded with potassium which can make them bitter, so the use of them in food is limited, but there some ideas and recipes later in this separate page <a href="#leaves">here</a>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The leaves of carrot (Daucus carota L.), are, more often than not, wasted. Carrot leaves are very rich in both nutrients such as vitamin C, β-carotene, fibers and several minerals such as Na, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Zn, and Fe .&nbsp;They have a pleasant taste and characteristics suitable for processing. They may be used as a raw basis for the preparation of several foods. The use of the byproducts of the vegetable industry has presented technological viability, and they have been used for the formulation of cream soups made of dehydrated vegetable stalks.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">This 2011 report&nbsp; concluded that (1) carrot leaves had high protein, carbohydrate and potassium content. So it could be used in several bakery products such as cakes, (2) Addition of 0.10% acetone carrot leave extract as a natural antioxidant equal the action of 200ppm of TBHQ as an artificial antioxidant in delaying oxidative rancidity until 45 days at 63�C. <i>(Goneim, &amp; A., Gehan &amp; Ibrahim, &amp; Y., Faten &amp; Elshehawy, Shady &amp; Sh.M,.

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Can you can eat the green leaves of carrots?</b> - This popular myth has been perpetuated through continual hearsay and personal anecdotes, but little scientific study to prove or disprove it. This has been a matter of debate for many years and the controversy and misguidance seems to continue.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">While it is true that carrot tops contain alkaloids and nitrates to which some people can be sensitive, they aren�t inherently toxic to most of us unless we eat them by the wheelbarrow-full.</span> &nbsp;The main reason there are conflicting reports is that there are poisonous look-a-likes that are often mistaken for Wild Carrot, please be familiar with all the characteristics of this wonderful wild edible before you enjoy them.&nbsp; I can only refer to the scientific reports at the <a href="#reference">end of this page</a>. I believe that the issue arose because the leaves contain alkaloids, a group of organic compounds that contain such nasty poisons as strychnine, cocaine, and caffeine.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">There is further information <a target="_blank" href="http://wellpreserved.ca/are-carrott-greens-toxic-deadly-edible/">here</a> from the Well Preserved Blog - Are Carrot Greens Toxic? Deadly? Edible?&nbsp; Many farmers consider that the greens will not be ultimately consumed and could well therefore apply pesticide sprays to them.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>Some clear benefits:</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Carrot tops have high chlorophyll content that may help heal skin and rid the body of toxins.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">They are high in potassium and help keep your blood pressure levels in control.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">They have detoxifying effects and are excellent for your kidneys.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">They are rich in vitamin K as well. Vitamin K is responsible for blood clotting and regulating blood calcium levels.</font></p>
<hr color="#00FF00" size="3" />
<p><font face="Arial">There have been accounts of people getting sick from eating carrot tops.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This is entirely possible and probably even true. It�s also possible and probably true that these people have either an allergy or an intolerance to carrot tops. There�s an important distinction between food allergy and food intolerance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Carrot Tops are loaded with vitamins and minerals. There is a persistent belief that the alkaloids in carrot tops make them slightly dangerous for consumption, but this isn�t really true, as alkaloids are a substance found throughout nearly every leafy green vegetable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">- Food allergy causes an immune system response to a particular food protein; the immune system overreacts and interprets the food as harmful, resulting in itching, swelling, trouble breathing, and even death in extreme cases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">- Food intolerance occurs when the body lacks an enzyme to process a particular food, causing unpleasant symptoms like nausea, abdominal cramping, or acid reflux; these are not immune system responses and are not life-threatening. Another reaction with similar symptoms is food poisoning, which is caused by bacteria or toxins.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF0000"><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" src="photos/leaf1.jpg" width="183" height="140" align="right" hspace="5" alt="Carrot Leaves" vspace="5" /></font></font></font>This may be possible with commercial carrots that have been heavily sprayed with pesticides (since the greens are most affected), but likely not a problem with organic or home grown carrots. A true food allergy to carrots is uncommon, but an interesting reaction called oral allergy syndrome (OAS) can occur in people who are allergic to birch pollen and mugwort pollen. The major allergen in carrots, a protein called Dau c 1, is so similar in structure to the molecules in birch pollen and mugwort pollen that the body can�t tell the difference. That means if you have an allergy to either, eating carrots can trigger a reaction in the form of itching or swelling of the mouth or throat. According to WebMD, the symptoms of OAS become less severe when you cook the trigger food because heat alters the offending protein. All this basically means a person could have an unexpected cross-reactive allergy, food allergy, or food intolerance to carrot tops (as one might have with dairy or wheat) � but that does not make them toxic.</font></p>
<hr />
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Included in the carrot family - Apiaceae ("umbellifers") - are the well-known plants: angelica, anise, arracacha, asafoetida, caraway, carrot, celery, Centella asiatica, chervil, cicely, coriander (including cilantro), cumin, dill, fennel, hemlock, lovage, Queen Anne's lace, parsley, parsnip, sea holly, and the now extinct silphium.&nbsp; Some of this family are poisonous, but not carrot!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Why carrot tops are generally not eaten</b> in our culture is a mystery though they are considered a market vegetable in many parts of Europe). Just because an item is not culturally popular does not mean it is not nutritious or can�t be eaten; in fact, the leaves of root vegetables tend to be more healthful than the roots themselves. One reason is to do with taste, as the flavour and texture of carrot tops can take some getting used to. You should consider carrot tops to be more of an accent and use them that way to add earthiness to a recipe. Carrot tops taste like a very concentrated carrot, so they�re ideal in soups, salads and sandwiches in small quantities. To get past the texture, the leaves should be de-stemmed and chopped up finely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>IF</b> carrot greens are toxic or "poisonous" then one would think that USDA or the UK Department of Agriculture would have concerns and introduce regulations to prevent stores from selling them, or at least enforce the display of a warning notice?&nbsp;One of the leading US food scientists, Harold McGee) <a onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com']);" href="http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/06/harold-mcgee-responds-part-1/">has declared them as safe</a>. People say "you don't see them in the supermarket" - very true - but this is mainly because the greens continue to draw moisture from the root and therefore dry out the carrot more quickly, and hence removed to improve shelf life.&nbsp; In fact some supermarkets DO sell them with the tops attached, usually at a premium price.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><a onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/food/inspection/fruitveg/risk_assessment_pdf/carrot/50ra.pdf']);" href="http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/food/inspection/fruitveg/risk_assessment_pdf/carrot/50ra.pdf">A report on the Risk of Carrots</a> from the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs records the production phase of growing carrots as&nbsp; a Low-High risk of contamination based on �Many agricultural chemicals applied to carrot tops would not contaminate the edible root.&nbsp; Contamination may occur where errors are made in application, not following product label information, or where chemicals not registered for use are used. Health Canada regulates chemicals used in the production of food (46, and 64).�&nbsp; This suggests we should eat organic, thus avoiding the farmers chemicals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I have visited stores, markets, farmers markets of all sizes in 25 countries of the world and NEVER seen them banned or warned against.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img src="photos/leaves1.jpg" style="max-width:100%;HEIGHT:auto; alt=" world="" carrot="" museum="" carrots="" /></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>The leaves of carrot ARE considered edible</b> and are highly nutritive, rich in protein, minerals and vitamins. They contain 6 times the vitamin C of the root and are a great source of potassium and calcium. The tops of the carrots are loaded with potassium which can make them bitter,</font> so the use of them in food is limited, but there some <a href="#leaves">ideas and recipes</a> below. &nbsp;The leaves do have antiseptic qualities and can be juiced and used as a mouthwash.</p>
<p align="left"><b><a name="nutrition"></a>Flavour and Nutrition</b> -</p>
<p align="left"><b>Nutrients</b> - Carrot greens contain an impressive list of nutrients, including significant amounts of vitamin A, dietary fibre, vitamin C, calcium, and iron. There is no fat or cholesterol in these greens, and there are roughly 90 calories in 1 cup of these raw greens. These greens also contain vitamin K and various phenolic compounds and carotenoids, along with trace amounts of other antioxidants.</p>
<p align="left"><i>(Reference - <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf070482z">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf070482z</a>) J. Agric. Food Chem.200755156395-6400</i></p>
<p align="left">Carrot tops have a peppery flavor, similar to arugula or parsley and can bring that same sort of spice to a range of dishes. When cooking with them, remove the fibrous stems, as you would any other tender herb such as parsley or dill.</p>
<p align="left">These greens are packed with chlorophyll, a phytochemical that gives plants their green colour and pigmentation. Chlorophyll is an excellent source of magnesium, which promotes healthy blood pressure as well as strong bones and muscles, and has been noted to purify the blood, lymph nodes and adrenal glands</p>
<p align="left">They are high in potassium, which can lower blood pressure, support your metabolism, and help prevent osteoporosis. People most at risk for heart disease are the ones who get too little potassium.</p>
<p align="left">What's more, carrot greens are rich in vitamin K, which is lacking in the carrot itself and is vital to bone health. They have also been noted to deter tumour growth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Carrot greens contain alkaloids (which are toxic bitter compounds produced by a plant) and all alkaloids are bad because substances like caffeine and cocaine are alkaloids. <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">BUT! - all leafy greens (including �good for you� greens like spinach and kale) contain varying levels and types of alkaloids, some higher than others. Alkaloids are chemical compounds believed to be part of a plant�s defence mechanisms.</span></p>
<p align="left">This applies to both Wild Carrot leaves as well as domestic.</p>
<hr />
<p align="left"><i><b>A simple use of them is</b></i> to mix some in with a mixed green salad, or add to coleslaw. You may also use it for garnish. Combine your common sense and your creative skills, and invent something! That's what makes cooking fun. It is a form of art.&nbsp; Carrot greens are high in vitamin K, which is lacking in the carrot itself.</p>
<p align="left">Carrot tops are an outstanding source of chlorophyll, the green pigment that studies have shown to combat the growth of tumours. Chlorophyll contains cleansing properties that purify the blood, lymph nodes, and adrenal glands. Scientists have been unable to synthesize chlorophyll in the laboratory, but green plant foods contain sufficient quantities to protect the human body.</p>
<p align="left">The leaves do contain furocoumarins that may cause allergic contact dermatitis from the leaves, especially when wet. Later exposure to the sun may cause mild photodermatitis. (This is NOT the same as 'poisonous' - it will only affect susceptible people with allergies to the plant. Some people have the same reaction to yarrow, ragwort, chamomile etc.)</p>
<p align="left">Carrot leaves contain significant amounts of porphyrins, which stimulate the pituitary gland and lead to the release of increased levels of sex hormones.<br />
<br />
There is a distinct difference between toxins and allergens. Carrots (Daucus carota), whether wild or domesticated, are not toxic, they are allergenic. This is like peanuts, which are not toxic but can kill those who are allergic to them.<br />
<b>It is however&nbsp; important that any wild plant be positively identified before it is used for food.</b> The tiny tops have tiny almost feathery branches. Carrot seedlings look a lot like bindweed. It takes a while to figure out the differences. Bindweed is redder and the leaf arrangement looks sort of branchy.</p>
<p align="left">Also watch the video link on the <a href="cultivation.html">cultivation page</a>.</p>
<p><font face="Arial">The US Army Survival Handbook 2008, Department of the Army states - Worms or intestinal parasites � using moderation treatment with tea made from Tansy (tanacetum vulgare) or from wild carrot leaves. Also Gas and cramps - Use a tea made from carrot seeds as an antiflatulent. </font></p>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>AND MORE ON THE CONTROVERSY!&nbsp; -</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial">Carrots are part of the Umbelliferae family of plants, which includes not only the edible carrot, celery, parsnip, fennel, cumin, cilantro, and parsley, but also the toxic hemlock. Their membership in the same family explains their mutual affinity � who has not enjoyed the classic pairings of carrots and parsley, carrots and cumin, or (if you like cilantro), carrots and cilantro? These plants tend to store energy in the taproot, and have hollow stems with ample (often flowering) greenery. The poisonous varieties can be difficult to tell from safe wild varieties � wild carrot, for example, is almost indistinguishable from hemlock. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/queen.html#poison">read more here</a> on the differences and important clues to help distinguish them)<br />
<br />
I consider that carrot tops are actually edible and nutritious. The roots taste better because they have high levels of sugar and water. The toxicity linked to carrot tops is the same toxicity issue with any greens. That is that all greens contain alkaloids. When you eat the same type of greens all the time (like if you had spinach all the time or carrot tops all the time) then the levels of that plant�s alkaloids starts increasing in your system. Alkaloids are toxic in high amounts. Therefore the rule of thumb is that you need to keep rotating your greens.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The belief that carrot greens are poisonous may stem from their close botanical proximity to poison hemlock, but I have been unable to find any reported instances of carrot greens poisoning (as opposed to speculation about carrot greens as a poison). Although numerous gardening and amateur cooking sites cite the edibility of carrot greens.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Several poison control centres are silent on the matter.<br />
<br />
I eat carrot greens regularly, both in salads and soups and know of many others who have lived to tell the tale.<br />
<br />
Mild toxicity is a very wide term and not defined.&nbsp; Some people are allergic to carrot greens which can cause a skin rash, but not by ingestion.<br />
<br />
There is an allergenic substance in carrot tops, but for most of the population they are harmless and healthy. Carrot tops (even without carrots) are market vegetables in France, French cookbooks have recipes how to prepare them, they have been eaten for a long time.<br />
<br />
If you notice the carrot greens taste bitter, however, you may want to steer clear. Alkaloids � which often are toxic, to varying degrees � generally have a bitter taste. Not all alkaloids are so toxic that you can�t consume them � caffeine, for example, is an alkaloid that many people consume daily, and the alkaloid tomatine in tomato leaves appears to be harmless in small quantities<br />
<br />
There is a distinct difference between toxins and allergens. Carrots (Daucus carota), whether wild or domesticated, are not toxic, they are allergenic. This is like peanuts, which are not toxic but can kill those who are allergic to them.<br />
<br />
Carrot Tops are approved by the US military in their survival guide to make into a medicinal tea.</font></p>
<p>There have been accounts of people getting sick from eating carrot tops. This is entirely possible and probably even true. It�s also possible and probably true that these people have either an allergy or an intolerance to carrot tops.</p>
<p>Food allergy causes an immune system response to a particular food protein; the immune system overreacts and interprets the food as harmful, resulting in itching, swelling, trouble breathing, and even death in extreme cases.</p>
<p>Food intolerance occurs when the body lacks an enzyme to process a particular food, causing unpleasant symptoms like nausea, abdominal cramping, or acid reflux; these are not immune system responses and are not life-threatening. Another reaction with similar symptoms is food poisoning, which is caused by bacteria or toxins.</p>
<p><b>The bottom line!</b> - is there ANY documentary evidence of anyone, ever, being poisoned by the consumption of carrot greens? If you find some please let me know.</p>
<hr color="#000000" size="3" />
<p><a name="health"></a><b>Specific Health Benefits</b></p>
<p>1. Boost the Immune System<br />
<br />
One of the most prominent benefits of carrot leaves is its high amount of vitamin C. It is even believed that the vitamin C contained in carrot leaves is even greater than the one in the roots, about six times more. Which is why carrot leaves could be useful additions to chicken soup or salad, because combined with other ingredients, they can work together in boosting the immune system. They are particularly useful for relieving cold and equally beneficial for skin health.<br />
<br />
2. Help Preventing Tumour Growth<br />
<br />
The most common compound contained in green leaves is chlorophyll. It is the one chemical that is responsible for photosynthesis as well as making the leaves of plants green. Turns out, chlorophyll also contains powerful nutrients whose main function is to prevent tumour cells from growing. Some researches suggested that carrot leaves have the ability to hinder tumour growth which in turn restricting malignant cell division.<br />
<br />
3. Act as Mild Diuretics<br />
<br />
Aside from preventing tumour growth, there is another benefit of chlorophyll contained in carrot leaves. Though may not widely known, chlorophyll in fact can act as a mild diuretic, which helps in stimulating the outflow of bodily fluid in the form of urine.<br />
<br />
4. Aid in Detoxification<br />
<br />
Chlorophyll also has detoxifying effect to our bodies, which explain the similar effect found in other green leaves such as green tea. The detoxifying effect in turn helps the kidney to filter harmful substances in our blood, consequently preventing the formation of kidney stones as well as dissolving those already present.<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Support the Digestive System<br />
<br />
The benefits of chlorophyll goes along the way. As it turned out, the detoxifying properties of chlorophyll also help in cleansing the colon as well as relaxing it. Combined with the dietary fiber normally found in greens, they work together in stimulating bowel movement, pushing out the wastes from digestion which in turn improving the absorption of nutrients.<br />
<br />
6. Protect Heart Health<br />
<br />
Carrot leaves is also high in potassium, which is known for its effect in regulating blood pressure. Those who are high in blood pressure usually have potassium deficiency. Therefore adding carrot leaves to our daily meal might keep our health healthy by lowering high blood pressure and thus preventing stroke commonly caused by atherosclerosis.<br />
<br />
7. Help in Maintaining Muscles� Endurance<br />
<br />
Not only are carrot leaves rich in macronutrients, they also pack some minerals which work together for common good. Take for example, magnesium. This mineral is known for its role in preventing inflammation by reinforcing the muscle tissues in all over our body. Combined with other mineral such as potassium, the compound of the two can work together in strengthening muscles and improving blood flow which keep us energetic throughout the day.<br />
<br />
8. Promote Bone Strength and Health<br />
<br />
Not only minerals, carrot leaves also contain some beneficial vitamins, one of them is vitamin K which is important for blood clotting as well as increasing bone density. Combined with minerals such as calcium and magnesium, vitamin K can promote overall bone health as well as strength, greatly reducing the chances of bone and joint problems such as osteoporosis.<br />
<br />
9. Help Maintaining Eye Health<br />
<br />
Carrot leaves are as equally as nutritious as their own carrot roots! Carrot leaves do contain high amount of vitamin A which has well-known benefit of keeping eyes� health. Which makes it a good idea to eat the carrot plants whole, roots and leaves.<br />
<br />
10. Help Improving Blood Circulation<br />
<br />
As discussed on earlier paragraphs, carrot leaves are rich in magnesium and potassium which work great together in keeping our blood circulations in order. Improved blood circulation also means better metabolism, sharper focus and of course essential for maintaining overall body health.<br />
<br />
<br />
11. Regulate Blood Pressure<br />
<br />
Both potassium and magnesium also play essential parts in keeping blood pressure in check. Multiple studies have been done to find significant correlations between magnesium intake and the reduction of blood pressure.<br />
<br />
12. Prevent Anaemia<br />
<br />
For those who are anaemic, consuming carrot leaves can help boosting haemoglobin productions in red blood cells, which in turn can prevent anaemia. For those who need some haemoglobin boosts but averse to blood supplements, carrot leaves can be safe and natural alternatives.<br />
<br />
13. Serve as Menstruation Supplement<br />
<br />
There is this kind of chemical compounds which is quite unique found in carrot leaves. They are called porphyrins, which are more commonly found in wild carrot leaves. The main function of porphyrins� include stimulating the pituitary gland which in turn releases sex hormones.<br />
<br />
Consequently, the hormones stimulates the uterus, which means those on their period can control their menstruation cycles. However, because it has an effect in inducing uterine contractions, it is strongly prohibited to be used by women in pregnancy.<br />
<br />
14. Help Treating Kidney Problem<br />
<br />
The most common trait shared by bitter greens is that they are all strong diuretics. Which means carrot leaves can be used to help stimulating the filtering process of kidneys by speeding the outflow of urine. This also serves to be solution to many kidney problems such as oedema and kidney stones.<br />
<br />
15. Relieve Migraine Headaches<br />
<br />
Carrot leaves are so heavy in vitamin and minerals that they can act as a natural health supplements. Not only that, they can also relieve headaches, including migraine headaches. Migraine is a kind of headaches symptom which occur on one side of the head, characterised by the agonizing pain it caused, often induces dizziness and nausea as the side effects.<br />
<br />
The reason is because most of the time, migraines are caused by nutritional deficiencies, which also including anemia and low blood pressures. Therefore, by consuming carrot leaves, whether mixed salad or juiced together with other ingredients, might help in relieving migraines headaches and also preventing the migraines from happening again.</p>
<hr color="#000000" size="3" />
<p><a name="ww2tops"></a>During World War Two the British Ministry of Food were always trying to find new recipes and alternative foodstuffs for those not available.&nbsp; They came up with Carrot Tops and Potato Soup.</p>
<p>This is the extract from the Kitchen Front broadcast of 11 July 1942</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"The other day I was looking at a row of carrots in my garden, trying to make up my mind whether or not to start thinning them. It seemed a pity to pull up the little things that were hardly fit to eat, but on the other hand if I left them any longer none of them would ever be fit to eat, so in the end I decided. to be hard and ruthless. So up they came - tiny little roots no thicker than a baby�s finger. I put those in a salad just as they were, after washing them of course, though they didn't go very far they were lovely and crunchy and sweet. The feathery green tops were still lying on the kitchen table when I came out to start the washing up after lunch.</i></p>
<p><i>My first impulse was to put then in the bucket for the rabbits, but on second thoughts they looked too good and tender even for my sweetest baby rabbits, so I decided to try and do something with them for supper for ourselves. What I did in the end, was to make a carrot-top and potato soup, and though it tasted quite different from anything we'd tried before, we liked it very much, and I felt extremely bucked at having invented a new dish. It was very easy to make, and this is how I did it. I happened to have some stock in the larder, so I put it in a saucepan and while it was coming to the boil chopped up the feathery carrot tops on the board, quite roughly, and peeled four large old potatoes.</i></p>
<p><i>As soon as the stock boiled I added the carrot tops and then the potatoes, cut into dice. Then I left the soup simmering with the lid on. After about twenty minutes the potato cubes were cooked, and I then added a little milk, and thickened the soup with some flour. A good pinch of some and it was ready. We each had a large plateful and some bread and cheese to go with it., and felt we had really discovered something � a carrot dish that did not taste at all like carrots, but was extraordinarily good all the same."</i></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">In the reign of James I</font>, (1603)&nbsp; it became the fashion for ladies to use flowers, fruit, feathers and the like to decorate their clothes. <img src="gifs/carothat1.gif" width="118" height="118" alt="Picture showing carrot leaves in a hat" align="right" />This was amusingly extended to the use of Wild Carrot flowers and its feathery leaves and stalks to decorate their hair, hats, sleeves, dresses and coats. The lacy green foliage&nbsp; was especially fashionable during the autumn months when the leaves took on a reddish colouration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parkinson, the celebrated botanist to King James mentions "That in his day, ladies wore carrot leaves in place of feathers -the light feathery verdure of which caused them to be no contemptible substitute for the plumage of birds..&nbsp;&nbsp; In winter, an elegant chimney ornament is sometimes formed, by cutting off a section from the head or thick end of a carrot, containing the bud, and placing it in a shallow vessel with water. Young and delicate leaves unfold themselves, forming a radiated tuft, of a very handsome appearance, and heightened by contrast with the season of the year."</p>

<p align="left"><a name="medicinal"></a>Carrot greens have antiseptic qualities, so they have been added to mouthwashes and, mixed with honey, to disinfect sores. They are also diuretic (increase urine flow), and can help treat kidney disease and edema.</p>
<p align="left">Chewing carrot leaves can heal injuries in the mouth, bad breath, gum bleeding and mouth ulcers.</p>
<p align="left">As a matter of interest it was <font color="#FF0000">Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides</font> (c. 40-c. 90) <span lang="EN-GB">who catalogued over 600 medicinal plant species and said</span> that the Greeks used carrot leaves against cancerous tumours. So you could always try that too!</p>
<p align="left">Also in 1578 Henry Lyte wrote - <i>The greene leaves of Carrots "boiled with honey and laid to, do cleanse and mundifie (purify) uncleane and fretting sores" (- a type of poultice)</i> <a href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/herbalists.html#lyte">(read more about H Lyte on a separate Museum page here)</a></p>
<p align="left">Carrot leaves were included in the 'potherbs' of old, but originally, of course, only Queen Anne's Lace was used (QAL is Wild Carrot). They are also an ancient source for yellow dye. <a href="#dye">(read more below)</a></p>
<p align="left">The carrot leaves are pretty, but bitter, so what about using them on something that is robust in flavour, but boring in appearance?</p>
<hr color="#00FF00" size="3" />
<p align="left"><b><a name="leaves"></a>Some eating suggestions:</b></p>
<p align="left">Carrot Tops add an earthiness to a recipe, they are ideal in soups, salads and sandwiches in small quantities.</p>
<p align="left">Sprinkle some in a green salad for a great unique taste and extra crunch. If the rough texture is no<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">t to your liking, the leaves should be de-stemmed and chopped up finely.&nbsp; Try d</span>ecorate a pate with it, and glace it with aspic.<br />
<br />
What about a "carrot top pesto vinaigrette"? You can hide the bitterness under the tangy vinegar, and sweeten it slightly with some honey.</p>
<p align="left">Carrot greens cooked in butter, with a little garlic or smoked bacon you don't know what you are missing!</p>
<p align="left">Try saut�ing the chopped carrot tops lightly in olive oil with garlic and onion. Then add other garden-grown veggies (the carrots themselves, zucchini, tomato, peppers, fresh herbs), saut� some more, then fold the entire garden mish-mash inside a whole wheat tortilla, brown it, and call it a quesadilla. Truly a great vegan treat, and the carrot tops gave a nice crunchy texture.</p>
<p align="left">It is a delightful garden feast. I recommend adding your carrot tops to other things you may already have simmering on the stove. <img border="0" src="photos/leaf1.jpg" width="375" height="280" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></p>

<p align="left"><b>Carrot Top Soup Recipe</b></p>
<p align="left">6 small to medium carrots with tops and roots<br />
2 tablespoons butter<br />
3 tablespoons white rice<br />
2 large leeks, white parts only<br />
2 thyme or lemon thyme sprigs<br />
2 tablespoons chopped dill, parsley, or celery leaves<br />
salt and freshly ground pepper<br />
6 cups vegetable stock, chicken stock, or water<br />
Pull or pluck the lacy leaves of the carrot greens off their stems. You should have between 2-3 cups, loosely packed. Wash, then chop finely. Grate the carrots or, if you want a more refined-looking soup, finely chop them. Melt the butter in a soup pot. Add the carrot tops and carrots, rice, leeks, thyme, and dill. Cook for several minutes, turning everything a few times, then season with 1 1/2 teaspoons slat and add the stock. Bring to the boil and simmer until the rice is cooked, 16-18 minutes. Taste for salt, season with pepper, and serve.</p>

<b>Carrot Top Tea</b><br />
<br />
This is such an unbelievably delicious drink and great for detoxifying and strengthening the kidneys. Excellent for anyone suffering from urinary complaints.<br />
<br />
Take a handful of carrot leaves (home grown are always best but shop bought carrots can be used as long as you thoroughly wash then to remove any chemical residues), tear them up and put them in a tea pot. Pour over boiling water and leave to steep until the tea is cold. Strain to remove the leaves and put them on the compost heap, then place the tea in the fridge to chill. It will last well for about 3 days if it hasn't all been drunk before then.<br />
Carrots store best with their tops removed so making tea from the leaves is an excellent use of resources. Young leaves can also be used in salads.

<p><b>Gumbo Z'herbes Recipe � A New Orleans Delight!</b></p>
<p>Coming from the French gumbo aux herbes, this gumbo is the green variety to which several greens are used in the roux to make the ideal meat-free meals for Good Friday, Holy Thursday and the entire stretch of Lent!&nbsp; Serves 12.</p>
<p>1 large or two small ham shanks or hocks</p>
<p>At least seven varieties of the following greens: 1 bunch greens, either mustard, collard or turnip or a combination of all three 1 bag fresh spinach or a box of frozen 1 small head cabbage 1 bunch <b>carrot tops</b> 1 bunch beet tops 1 bunch Arugula 1 bunch parsley 1 bunch green onions 1 bunch watercress 1 head romaine or other lettuce 1 head curly endive 1 bunch kale 1 bunch radish tops</p>
<p>3 medium yellow onions, roughly chopped</p>
<p>1/2 head garlic, peeled, cloves kept whole</p>
<p>2 lbs. fresh hot sausage (a local sausage called chaurice is best, but Italian without fennel works well)</p>
<p>1 lb. andouille sausage</p>
<p>1 lb. smoked pork sausage</p>
<p>� lb. ham 1 lb. beef stew meat</p>
<p>1 cup flour Vegetable oil as needed</p>
<p>3 teaspoons dried thyme 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper 3 bay leaves Salt to taste</p>
<p>2 cups cooked white rice</p>
<p>� teaspoon fil� powder (optional)</p>
<p><b>Directions:</b></p>
<p>1. Place ham shanks or hocks in a large, heavy stock pot. Fill the pot with water and bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer while you prepare the other ingredients.</p>
<p>2. Wash all greens thoroughly in salt water, making sure to remove any grit, discolored outer leaves, and tough stems. Rinse in a bath of unsalted water (a clean double sink works well for this).</p>
<p>3. Place half the greens, half the onions, and half the garlic in a heavy-bottomed stockpot or 3�4 gallon saucepan. Cover greens and vegetables with water and bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 20�30 minutes, until greens are very tender. When they finish cooking, transfer them to a large bowl, using a slotted spoon, to cool. Repeat the process with the remaining greens, onions and garlic, doing it in two or three batches if necessary.</p>
<p>4. When all the greens have finished cooking, reserve the cooking liquid.</p>
<p>5. Place the fresh hot sausage in a skillet or medium-size saucepan and set over medium heat. Cook until rendered of fat and moisture. Remove the hot sausage with a slotted spoon and set aside. Reserve the fat.</p>
<p>6. While the fresh hot sausage is cooking, cut the smoked sausage and andouille into 1/2-inch rounds and set aside. Cut the ham and the beef stew meat into 1/2-inch pieces and set aside.</p>
<p>7. In a meat grinder or a food processor, grind the greens, onion and garlic into a puree, adding cooking liquid to prevent the greens from getting too thick. Do this in batches.</p>
<p>8. Remove the ham shanks from their cooking liquid, reserving the liquid for stock. Once the shanks cool, pick and chop the meat and set it aside; discard the bones and the fat.</p>
<p>9. Pour the greens cooking liquid and ham stock into separate bowls. Using your largest pot, or the two stockpots in which you simmered the greens and the ham, mix everything together. (Divide the pureed greens, the sausages, the beef and the chopped ham equally between the two pots, if using two pots.)</p>
<p>10. Fill the pot or pots with equal parts ham stock and greens cooking liquid and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.</p>
<p>11. Heat the skillet containing the hot sausage drippings over medium-high heat. With a wooden spoon, slowly but intently stir in the flour until well combined. If the mixture is very dry, add vegetable oil until it loosens some, making a tight paste that�s still able to be stirred.</p>
<p>12. Continue to cook until the flour mixture begins to darken, stirring constantly. As Sara notes, you aren�t going for a dark roux, but you do want the flour to cook. Courage is the key here. Don�t be afraid to let it get dark.</p>
<p>13. When darkened and cooked, divide the roux between the two stockpots or put it into the single pot, dropping it in by spoonfuls and whisking to make sure that each is well incorporated.</p>
<p>14. Add thyme, cayenne, bay leaves and salt to taste.</p>
<p>15. Simmer for about an hour, or until the stew meat is tender, stirring quite often. Add more stock or water if it appears too thick. Serve over white rice.</p>
<p>Note: Fil� in its pure form is a bright green powder made from pounded sassafras leaves. The Creoles and Cajuns picked it up from the Choctaw Indians, and used it as a spice and a thickener in the winter when okra wasn�t available. If you like it, add it slowly at the end of cooking or even stir it into your own bowl at the table.&nbsp;</p>
