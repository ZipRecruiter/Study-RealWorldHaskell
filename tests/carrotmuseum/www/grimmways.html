The story of Grimmway began in 1968, when brothers Rod and Bob Grimm set up a roadside produce stand and planted the seed that would blossom into today�s Grimmway Farms. Ten years later, the brothers moved north to Kern County, where the family business took root and prospered from their dedication to product quality and customer service. For more than 45 years, our commitment to that promise continues to be upheld as a top priority.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">In 1985 Grimmway moved the carrot processing plant to Bakersfield, CA where the climate enables two annual carrot crops.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">Grimmway grow carrots in a variety of regions in California to ensure ideal growing conditions year round. Carrots thrive in the sandy, loamy soils of California. These soils, combined with the ideal California climate (75� to 85�days and cool nights 50� to 60�), provide the optimal growing conditions. As a result, they transition growing areas throughout Central and Southern California to ensure just-picked carrots are delivered to their customers for every season. - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.grimmway.com/carrots/our-process/where-we-grow/">See more here.</a></font></p>
