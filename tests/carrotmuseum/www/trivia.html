<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">Did you know?</font> - It would take 7920 8 inch carrots to make a mile of carrots (4921 in a kilometer). It would mean you would require 103,348,080 carrots to reach end to end of the Great Wall of China (13049 miles/21000km long). Approximately 6,200,884 metric tonnes (10 times the annual UK production - one carrot avg 60g)</p>
<p align="left">The calories you burn are equivalent to how much energy you use while walking, which is mainly a factor of your weight and the distance that you walk. A simple rule of thumb is 100 calories per mile for a 160 pound person. So that's about 3 carrots a mile.</p>

<p align="left"><b>The 1551 edition</b> of the "Libro de Agricultura" by Gabriel Alonso de Herrera records the "colour of oranges" to describe carrots.</p>
<p><b>One of the first written evidences</b> of an orange carrot, particularly written in English (and therefore cannot be misinterpreted during translation) is Hortus Medicus Edinburgensis – A Catalogue of plants in the Physical Garden at Edinburgh by James Sutherland intendent of said garden in 1683.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This work makes reference to Orange, Red, Yellow and White carrots, together with the common Wild Carrot. It and also distinguishes them from Parsnip as a separate plant. <a href="photos/edinburgh1.jpg">See extract here)</a>. This is a very useful record as it shows what actually existed in the botanic garden in Edinburgh.</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">DID YOU KNOW:</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;- One square meter of U.S. carrot production (one crop) is adequate to fulfill vitamin A needs for one adult for one year.</p>
<p>- Carrot juice is used for many things besides drinking. Ed Ruscha, who is a master printer and artist uses carrot juice instead of printer ink. He has also printed with spinach juice, chocolate and strawberries.&nbsp; Read more about Ed Ruscha <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Ruscha">here.</a> Read more about the wonder and health benefits of Carrot Juice <a target="_blank" href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/carrotjuice.html">here</a>.<img border="0" src="photos/pyramid1.jpg" align="right" width="175" height="143" /></p>
<p>- a pyramid of carrots containing 3 tons of carrots would be approximately 4 feet square and 4 feet tall.&nbsp; If we take the estimate of 27,500 carrots as 3 tons, and assume an average volume of 1.2 cubic inches for each carrot, then the base of a square pyramid would be approximately 4 feet by 4 feet. The height would be nearly the same. This assumes the carrots on the base are laid out in one direction and alternated for each successive layer.&nbsp; Calculations from Bolthouse Carrots!</p>
<p>- If you dug a hole to the Earth’s centre and dropped a carrot in it, it would take just over 40 minutes to reach the middle</p>
<p>- Although, there are many different carrot varieties available, British farmers tend to grow the Nairobi variety, a berlicum-nantes cross, which is reliable, damage resistant and produces a good yield.</p>

<p><img src="gifs/carrots-a.gif" width="40" height="40" align="middle" /><b>Is a Carrot a <a name="veg">Vegetable or Fruit?</a></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In the European Union Jam Directive, written in the 80s and updated in 2001, it describes the parameters required for a product to be labelled as jam or marmalade and from which the UK Jam and Similar Products legislation is based, there is the phrase "for the purposes of this directive, tomatoes, the edible part of rhubarb stalks, <font color="#FF0000">carrots</font>, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins, melons and water melons <font color="#FF0000">are considered to be fruit</font>". This was introduced to pacify the Portuguese who are strongly into Carrot Marmalade!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Of course carrots are not biologically a fruit as they do not carry the seeds, and the above paragraph in the jam directive does not reclassify them as such, just allows them to be used as fruit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Duerrs, the famous British Jam maker does not use any carrots in their products, although <img src="gifs/2prong.gif" width="60" height="59" align="right" alt="twin carrot" />many years ago they did try carrot jam and tomato jam. It is recalled that this was to try out what the products would taste like due to the above mentioned in the jam directive. The unanimous conclusion at the time was that tomato jam was actually very nice but carrot jam was awful! <a target="_blank" href="jam.html">Try this Carrot Jam Recipe.</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Marmalade is a curiously British term, marmalade means a jam made with citrus fruit. The term was fought over in the European Community as other countries wanted to do away with it or change its meaning. Marmalade contains citrus fruit (sometimes with something else like ginger or ) and is usually characterised by the cut of the peel. Marmalade is thought to have originated in Portugal, where quinces (marmelo) were cooked with sugar to make a preserve. The British were the first to add the peel back to orange marmalade, to make the preserve set instead of using apple juice, hence the British tradition of orange marmalade. Carrot is definitely a vegetable. Though vegetable is strictly a culinary term, and open to mis-interpretation. <a target="_blank" href="marmalade.html">Carrot Marmalade Recipe here.</a></font>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Wikipedia gives a good definition here:&nbsp; <a onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable</a></p>
<p>Normally a vegetable is a part of a plant which is edible (usually grown to be eaten) and does not contain the seeds, or is not formed from the flower.</p>
<p>For example an apple tree flowers, the flower then turns into the actual apple, which in turn contains seeds.&nbsp; Same with a banana, plum etc.&nbsp; Hence a tomato is a fruit.</p>
<p>A vegetable like the carrot, flowers and produces seeds externally, usually in the form of a seed bud from the flower.</p>
<p>Carrot is biennial, flowering in the second year, above ground.</p>

The Dutch variety named De Dutwick is a rather shorter kind than the Half Long Red varieties yet bear no analogy to the Early Scarlet Horn. It is a pretty good kind for field culture, but the Blunt pointed Half Long varieties are much better."</p>

<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">The Arracacha (also know as Peruvian carrot) ( Arracacia xanthorriza ) is a garden root vegetable originally from the Andes, somewhat intermediate between the carrot and celery and related to them. Its starchy taproot is a popular food item in South America, especially in Brazil where it is a major commercial crop. The name arracacha (or racacha ) was borrowed into Spanish from Quechua, and is used in the Andean region. The plant is also called apio criollo (" Creole celery") in Venezuela, zanahoria blanca ("white carrot") in Ecuador, virraca in Peru, and mandioquinha ("little cassava") or batata-baroa in Brazil. It is sometimes called white carrot in English, but that name properly belongs to white varieties of the common carrot. The leaves are similar to parsley, and vary from dark green to purple. The roots resemble fat short carrots, with lustrous off-white skin. The interior may be white, yellow, or purple.</p>

• Carrots, like other food, are travelling nearly 60 per cent further on the UK roads than in the 1970s.
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">• Much of this increase in food mileage is due to the centralisation of our food distribution systems. Most carrots are sold through the major supermarkets. The major retailers have around 76 per cent of the market share for fresh produce and 63 per cent of shoppers buy their fruit and vegetables from supermarkets.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">• Research by SAFE Alliance into carrot prices shows that although the supermarkets have more purchasing power than other retailers, savings are not passed on to the customer. The research also found that smaller retailers such as greengrocers and street markets can often provide locally grown carrots at a very similar price to the supermarket's carrots from further away.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">• Direct sales from the producer to the consumer are one way of reducing the distance our food travels, of increasing the likelihood that it is really fresh, and of creating a dialogue between farmers and consumers about the farming of our countryside.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">• Buy loose rather than pre-packed carrots, as pre-packed carrots are bulkier and cause more transport pollution as well as using more packing materials.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">• Buy local carrots direct from farm shops, farmers' markets or a box scheme. The Soil Association (tel 0117 929 0661) produces a list of such local food schemes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Carrots contain more sugar than any other vegetable, with the exception of beets.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Attempts have also been made to extract sugar from Carrots, but the resulting thick syrup refuses to crystallize, and in competition with either cane sugar or that obtained from the sugar beet, it has not proved commercially successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Carrot sugar, got from the inspissated juice of the roots, may be used at table, and is good for the coughs of consumptive children.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From 1 lb. of Carrots we can obtain 1 oz. and 11 grains of sugar</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since the sugars are concentrated in the carrots' core, generally those with larger diameters will have a larger core and therefore be sweeter.</p>

<p>After the carrots are dug, they are tied into bunches with red thread. These are given as gifts to visitors on Michaelmas Day. Any carrots with forked roots are thought to be especially lucky.</p>
<p>The Eve of St. Michael is the eve of bringing in the carrots, of baking the struan, of killing the lamb, of stealing the horses. The Day of St. Michael is the Day of the early mass, the day of the sacrificial lamb, the day of the oblation struan, the day of the distribution of the lamb, the day of the distribution of the struan, the day of the pilgrimage to the burial-ground of their fathers, the day of the burial-ground service, the day of giving and receiving the carrots with their wishings and acknowledgements, and the day of the oda - the athletics of the men and the racing of the horses. The Night of Michael is the night of the dance and the song, of the merry-making, of the love-making, and of the love-gifts.<br />
Some days before the festival of St. Michael the women and girls go to the fields and plains of the townland to procure carrots. The afternoon of the Sunday immediately preceding St. Michael's day is specially devoted to this purpose, and on this account is known as Domhnach Curran - Carrot Sunday. The carrot was a fertility symbol usually given from a woman to a man.</p>
<p>An ancient pagan festival, Christianized into the feast day of St. Michael, demonstrates the close relationship of magic to food. Wild carrots, a symbol of fertility were dug in late September to honour St. Michael, patron saint of the sea, a great celebration being held on September 29. The Sunday prior to St. Michael’s day the carrots were harvested by women singing special songs, forked roots being especially prized. They were typically dug by removing soil in an equal-sided triangle, using a special three-pronged mattock. They were tied with a red thread in bundles of three and presented by the women to their menfolk. The significance of the number three is believed to have originated as symbolic of the three stages of a woman’s life - girl, mother, crone - and later was Christianized to be symbolic of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.<b><br /></b></p>

Sometimes, a happy combination of ingredients is arrived at with gratifying results. This happened with French Carotte. As a mixture it is new but the components were in use over two centuries ago. In earlier time the word “Carotte” meant the roll of tobacco from which snuff users grated their own; today it names one of the finest bases, smooth and retentive, deserving only the best of perfumes. One such is sandalwood oil which is distilled from the aromatic wood of a small evergreen tree grown in the East, and has a delicate non-cloying aroma faintly suggestive of incense. Combining these select ingredients has produced a charming snuff of unique distinction."</p>

<p><b><a name="starling"></a>Birds Nest -</b> European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) face serious pressure from pathogens and parasites. Studies by biologist Larry Clark show that by lining their nests with select fresh vegetation, these birds are protecting themselves from a myriad of possible infections. Wild carrot (Daucus carota), for example, kills fowl mites in starling nests, although the precise mechanism by which this occurs is not known. The carrot contains the steroid B-sitosterol, a compound that repels mites and inhibits their egg-laying abilities.</p>
<p>This compound is also found in leaves of the margosa tree (Azadirachta indica), from which house sparrows often gather material to line their nests, and which some Native Americans employ as a tick repellent. Other chemicals in the plant may disrupt the mites' feeding behaviour, or delay mite development and colonisation within the nest. How starlings know to choose parasite-deterring plants like the wild carrot remains a bigger mystery.</p>
