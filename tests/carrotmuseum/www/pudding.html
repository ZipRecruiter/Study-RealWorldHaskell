<p align="center"><b><font size="5" color="#0000FF">Carrot Pudding History &amp; Recipes Through the Ages</font></b>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="left">Carrot pudding is a dish traditional to a wide range of cultures around the world. It can be served either as a savoury pudding (as an accompaniment to a regular meal) or as a sweet dessert. I believe there is confusion, because the term "cake" is fairly recent, probably 13th C and it could be that many puddings were in fact cakes - solid pudding.&nbsp; Read about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/recipes.html#cakeorigin">origin of carrot cake here</a>. Carrot Pie <a href="#pie">here</a>. The Wellcome Library has published a digital collection of historical recipe manuscripts ~ many on free download http://bit.ly/2rM09Kp.
<p>In the Oxford Companion to Food, writer Alan Davidson believes that carrots were used in Europe to make sweet cakes. These were a predecessor to the carrot cake. Because sweeteners were rationed during the Second World War carrot pudding was seen as an alternative in the UK. Later on, carrot cake was seen as a 'health food'.</p>
<p>Concealed beneath its decorative puff pastry cover, is a baked pudding enriched with bone marrow and delicately flavoured with rosewater. It belongs to a class of English puddings which were baked in a dish or pastry case, rather than being boiled or 'fired'. Puddings of this kind were closely related to tarts. They were always enriched with butter or marrow, rather than the much heavier suet used in boiled puddings. In his Academy of Armory and Blazon (Chester: 1688), Randle Holme calls this sort of pudding, 'a pudding pie'.</p>
<p>In 1726 Henry Carey wrote a dissertation on Dumplings and Puddings which claims that Puddings developed from dumplings which were basically lentils cemented together with fat. The Britons enhanced this recipe by adding milk and later eggs were included (by accident!) and the first puddings were born. These were made for the court of King John (1166-1216) by a lady cook ("good wife") and the English became known world wide as the great pudding eaters!&nbsp; A Learned Dissertation on Dumpling (1726) by Henry Carey:-</p>
<blockquote><i>"The Invention of Eggs was merely accidental, two or three of which having casually roll�d from off a Shelf into a Pudding which a good Wife was making, she found herself under a Necessity either of throwing away her Pudding, or letting the Eggs remain, but concluding from the innocent Quality of the Eggs, that they would do no Hurt, if they did no Good. She wisely jumbl�d �em all together, after having carefully pick�d out the Shells; the Consequence is easily imagined, the Pudding became a Pudding of Puddings; and the Use of Eggs from thence took its Date. The Woman was sent for to Court to make Puddings for King John, who then sway�d the Scepter; and gain�d such Favour, that she was the making of her whole Family." <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/28105/28105-h/28105-h.htm">source</a></i></blockquote>
<p>The cook's son, called John Brand, took over from his mother as the King's cook and became known as Jack Pudding and was knighted as "Knight of the Gridiron". They had Plain Pudding, Plumb Pudding, Marrow Pudding, Oatmeal Pudding, Carrot Pudding, Saucesage Pudding, Bread Pudding, Flower Pudding and Suet Pudding flavours.</p>
<p>Although recipes appear in seventeenth century cookery texts, this type of pudding reached its apogee in the following century. Popular flavours were marrow, almond, <b>carrot</b>, chestnut, lemon and Seville orange. Recipes abound in the popular cookery books of the Georgian period.</p>
<p>In Punjab, India, carrot pudding is called Gajar ka Halwa. Carrot pudding has been served in Ireland since at least the 18th century. It was also served in the United States as long ago as 1876.</p>

<p>Choose fresh tender and sweet carrots. Peel them and thinly slice them crosswise. For each pound of honey use 3 pounds of these carrots. Boil the honey and remove its froth. Pound the carrot in a stone mortar.&nbsp; Set a clean copper cauldron with a rounded bottom on a trivet on the fire, and put in it the skimmed honey and carrots. Cook the mixture on medium fire until the carrots fall apart.</p>
<p>Add walnut oil to the pot. For each pound of homey used add 2/3 cup of oil. Pistachio oil will be the best for it, but you can also use fresh oil of almond or sesame. Add the oil before the honey starts to thicken. However you do not need to stir the pot. You only scrape the bottom gently when mixture starts to thicken to prevent it from sticking to it. To check for doneness, use a stick or a spoon to see whether the pudding is thick enough or not yet.</p>
<p>When pudding becomes thick, put the pot down, and spread the dessert on a copper platter. Set it aside to cool down before serving. It will be firm and delicious.</p>

<p>The pudding is fairly easy to make once the idiosyncrasies of Mrs Toller�s language are overcome, she wrote it out the way she said it! There are two discrepancies in the course of testing: the egg whites are left out first, but must back in last (typical of other recipres of the period); and there is about twice the necessary amount of butter (maybe personal taste?). Less butter gives a better structure.</p>

<p>Pare off some of the crust of Manchet bread and grate off half as much of the rest as there is of the root, which must also be grated. Then take half a pint of half Cream or New Milk half a Pound of fresh Butter Six new laid Eggs (taking out three of the Whites) mash and mingle them well with the Cream and Butter. Then put in the grated Bread and with near half a Pound of Sugar and a little Salt ; some grated Nutmeg and beaten Spice and pour all into a convenient dish or pan buttered to keep the ingredients from sticking or burning; set it in a quick oven for about an Hour. And so have you a Composition for any Root Pudding.

<p class="MsoNormal">Grate half a pound of the sweetest and most delicate raw carrot, and double the quantity of white bread; mix eight beaten yolks and four whites of eggs, with half a pint of new milk; and melt half a pound of fresh butter, with half a pint of white wine, three spoonfuls of orange-flower water, a grated nutmeg, and sugar to palate. Stir the whole well together; and, if too thick, add more milk, till it be of a moderate consistency. Lay a puff paste all over the dish, and bake it an hour. Serve it up with sugar grated over.

<p>Carrot Pudding.</p>
<p>Take two or three large carrots, and half boil them; grate the crumb of a penny loaf and the red part of the carrots; boil as much cream as will make the bread of a proper thickness; when cold, add the carrots, the yolks of four eggs, beat well, a little nutmeg, a glass of white wine, and sugar to your taste. Butter the dish well, and lay a little paste round the edge. Half an hour will bake it.</p>
<p>Another way.</p>
<p>Take raw carrots, scraped very clean, and grate them. To half a pound of grated carrot put a pound of grated bread. Beat up eight eggs, leaving out the whites; mix the eggs with half a pint of cream, and then stir in the bread and carrots, with half a pound of fresh butter melted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In Victorian times, the upper classes would often eat very grand, fattening dishes. However, very few people were well-off, and the food eaten by the masses was often very simple, and cheap. Carrot pudding is a dish belonging to the latter food genre.</p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<p>One large carrot, Approximately one tablespoon biscuit powder,&nbsp; Three or four sweet biscuits, Four egg yolks, Two egg whites,&nbsp; 570ml cream, either raw or scalded, a few teaspoons ratafia <i>(an alcoholic beverage, beware! - brandy will do!),</i> a quarter of a nutmeg, 60g sugar.</p>
<p><b>Method&nbsp; -</b> Boil the large carrot until tender, and then mash it in a mortar. When the carrot is suitably mashed5, add the remaining ingredients, and stir the mixture together.</p>
<p>Bake all the ingredients in a shallow dish.</p>
<p>Times vary wildly for Victorian dishes, but 45 minutes at 180�C should do it.</p>

<p>Wash and scrape the carrots, and remove them from the water and cook them in good meat broth, and being cooked remove them and chop them small with the knife, adding to them mint and marjoram, and for each two pounds of chopped carrots a pound of Tronchon cheese and a pound and half of buttery Pinto cheese, and six ounces of fresh cheese, and one ounce of ground pepper, one ounce of cinnamon, two ounces of candied orange peel cut small, one pound of sugar, eight eggs, three ounces of cow's butter, and from this compostion make a torta with puff pastry above and below, and the tortillon with puff pastry all around, and make it cook in the oven, making the crust of sugar, cinnamon, and rosewater.

<p>Candied carrots taste nice on their own, but can also be served as a side dish with many savoury meals. The idea of adding golden syrup to carrots, and then eating them as part of a main course may seem a little strange, but the Victorians did it.</p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;� 500g carrots &nbsp;� Two tablespoons golden syrup � Salt (pinch) � Two tablespoons butter � Chopped mint or parsley</p>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<p>1. Slice the carrots length-wise, and then boil them in salt water until nice and tender, and then drain.<br />
2. In a separate pan, melt the syrup and butter together.<br />
3. Add the carrots to the syrup and butter, and cook for 10 minutes.<br />
4. Sprinkle some chopped mint or parsley over the top, and serve. A tablespoon of cream may also be added, according to personal preference.</p>
<p><b>Modern Indian Carrot Pudding</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;4 cups milk 2 tablespoons basmati rice 1 pound carrots -- peeled and minced 1/3 cup sugar 1/4 cup blanched almonds OR blanched pistachios -- chopped 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 1/4 cup heavy cream OR coconut milk 1 teaspoon rosewater silver and/or gold leaf slivers -- to garnish</p>
<p>In a heavy saucepan, place the milk over medium high heat, and bring to a boil. Sprinkle the rice into the boiling milk, stirring constantly for several minutes to keep the rice from settling on the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the rice at a gentle boil until the milk is reduced by half and the rice is tender, about 20 minutes, stirring often to prevent a skin from forming on the surface of the milk.</p>
<p>Stir the carrots into the milk-rice mixture and continue cooking until the carrots are tender and the mixture is reduced to a thick sauce, about 15 minutes; stir frequently to prevent scorching on the bottom.</p>
<p>Stir the sugar, about two-thirds of the almonds or pistachios, and the cardamom into the pudding and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to stick to the pan bottom, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, spoon into a bowl, and let cool to room temperature.</p>
<p>Stir 1/4 cup of the cream or coconut milk and the rosewater into the pudding. Cover tightly with plastic wrap or aluminium foil and chill for at least 3 hours.</p>
<p>Shortly before serving, remove from the refrigerator and check consistency; it should be a bit thinner than traditional rice pudding. If it seems too thick, stir in a little more cream or coconut milk. Spoon into individual bowls and sprinkle with the remaining almonds or pistachios and the silver and/or gold leaf (if used).</p>
<p>Notes : �In India, puddings like this are adorned for special occasions with slivers of tissue-thin silver leaf or gold leaf. These inert metals are edible and may be purchased at art-supply stores and some fancy-food shops.�</p>

<b>Ambrose heath - "War Time Recipes" - 1941</b> - Heath was one of the contributors to the �Kitchen Front� talks broadcast by the BBC during the Second World War. The talks were organized by the Ministry of Food to encourage frugality and palliate the hardship of rationing with recipes, household hints, exhortations from government officials and comedy. The �Kitchen Front� was a platform for propaganda, but of a homely and avuncular cast. These recipes appeared in a World War Two cookbook.
