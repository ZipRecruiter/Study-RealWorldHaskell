<p align="left">As far as the Carrot Museum is aware there are currently no chemical controls recommended for this insect. Highly residual insecticides will kill them sometimes, but not guaranteed and may leave the carrots roots inedible. Standard pesticides will be effective in some cases.

<p><b>Field Biology and Identification -</b> &nbsp;A moderate size 13 to 17 millimeter (1/2 � 11/16 inch), oblong‑ovate, dark reddish‑brown to black beetle. Wing covers have longitudinal depressed furrows with punctures. Adult beetles over winter in the soil and emerge in the spring to lay eggs. The larvae are C‑shaped and white, resembling common white grubs. They feed on grasses and decaying vegetation in the soil but will attack the roots of crops.</p>
<p><b>Plant Response and Damage -</b> &nbsp;The second‑brood adults feed two to 13 centimeters (one to five inches) below the surface on sunflower roots. Adult beetles chew on roots leaving a gouged appearance. Large infestations may cause stunting, wilting, and lodging.</p>
<p><b>Management -</b> &nbsp;Approaches No control is currently recommended for this insect.</p>
