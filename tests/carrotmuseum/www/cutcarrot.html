<p align="left">Carrots may be under achievers. Healthy and good for one's eyes and many other body organs, yes, but they could be so much more, researchers say. A major stress in a carrot's life � like the slash of a kitchen knife � and the tapered tuber kicks in the juice and pumps up its phytochemicals.<img border="0" src="photos/cultipic.jpg" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="8" width="200" height="150" /></p>
<p align="left">That's the finding of Dr. Luis Cisneros, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station food scientist. He calls it abiotic stress � pushing the button, so to speak, on a crop after it has been harvested.</p>
<p align="left">"What happens is that on many occasions, plants do not express their real potential. They can actually express more if they are challenged to a point," he said. "It's something similar to what would happen with people. You stress people, and people tend to respond more to the challenges in front of them," he added. "In this case, when you stress plants, you actually trigger this genetic response, and the plant will synthesize chemical compounds. You end up with a carrot that is healthier than the original carrot in a short period of time with a very cheap and easy stressor."</p>
<p align="left">A key to his research was understanding the plant's pathway to a specific, desired compound and getting it to increase only that one. So far, his lab has successfully increased the amount of antioxidant activity in carrots up to five times. The finding is important for food processors, Cisneros said, because as companies increasingly seek ways to add healthier components to foods, the technique could yield more of those desired substances. One kilogram of anthocyanin extract is valued at $1,000 in the marketplace, Cisneros said. Anthocyanin is the red pigment in vegetables which is associated with a reduced risk of cancer and heart disease.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="photos/newcarrotpic.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" width="180" height="240" />"So, if you stress (carrots) and they accumulate more anthocyanin, that means more money," he said. "Now imagine using that carrot to make a juice or making an extract of it that could be added to bread or some other product. You end up with an array of different products that you can benefit from." Growers also stand to gain, he said. In traditional vegetable marketing, the only way for a producer to make more money is to harvest higher yields.</p>
<p align="left">"But with this process, a grower could market not for the yield in tonnage, but for the percent of phytochemicals," he explained. Other current research on producing phytochemicals in foods focuses on breeding fruits and vegetables to have increased amounts of the compounds, Cisneros noted. While that is beneficial, the ability to quadruple the phytochemical with a simple, post-harvest technique would add even more value. In his lab, the "wounded," or cut, carrots were placed under an ultraviolet light for a few seconds.</p>
<p align="left">Analysis a couple of days after that simple treatment showed a "huge increase" in antioxidants, he said. "Abiotic stress has been known for decades," he said. "But our work is new because we targeted something specific to accumulate what we wanted. We used stress to manipulate." The finding opens the door for more research, he said. "We are trying to see if these responses can be duplicated in other types of plants � different types of fruits and vegetables," he said. "We want to see the signal molecule that is promoting these types of responses to maybe improve the way we are applying these stresses."</p>

<p align="left">Not only do some plants respond favourably on Earth, Cisneros-Zevallos also sees them doing so in space:<br />
If one thinks that plants can be grown -- obviously for food purposes -- on Mars, they'd have to be done under conditions very different that those found on Earth. Very low pressures, very low oxygen levels, perhaps high levels of carbon dioxide.<br />
He's worked with NASA and fellow Texas A&amp;M Professor Fred Davies to look at how the plants perform in these seemingly harsh conditions. Cisneros-Zevallos was encouraged by what they found:<br />
"What we saw is that some of these plants when exposed to these conditions synthesized more antioxidants, which is amazing.<br />
Not all plants respond favourably to this kind of treatment, but Cisneros-Zevallos has seen positive antioxidant results in lettuce, celery, carrots, parsnips and sweet potatoes."<br />
The reason Cisneros-Zevallos is trying to boost antioxidants in the first place is because researchers think antioxidants can protect your cells against the effects of free radicals.<br />
Free radicals are molecules produced when your body breaks down food, or by environmental exposures like tobacco smoke and radiation. Free radicals can damage cells, and may play a role in heart disease, cancer and other diseases.</p>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#FF0000">BUT - A word of caution -</font></b></p>
<p align="left">The 'antioxidants' he talks about (mainly chlorogenic acids) are the same compounds that make bitter carrots bitter. So even if they might be good for you, no-one would actually want to eat those carrots. It is doubtful that this scientist never tried actually eating any of them! And there is more chlorogenic acid in a cup of coffee (which of course is supposed to be bitter) than in even the most hideously bitter carrots, so if this was so good for health, then coffee drinkers would be much healthier than others, which they are not.</p>
<p align="left">The benefit of this type of study is debateable, as it creates more confusion than enlightenment!</p>
