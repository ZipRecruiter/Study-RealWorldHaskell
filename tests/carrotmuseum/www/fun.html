<p align="left">The popularity of the carrot is not simply due to its health benefits, delicious flavour and ease of growing. Carrots have become popular at least in part because of the way they have entered the public imagination. Much of the credit must go to Bugs Bunny, who first appeared on our screens in 1938. Bugs has had numerous catchphrases, the most prominent being a casual "Eh... What's up, doc?", usually said while chewing a carrot. From this moment on carrots were associated with fun and enjoyment.</p>

Little carrot says "But there is so much traffic here I'm afraid I might get run over."</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><img src="gifs/rabbit_eating_carrot_lg_clr.gif" width="156" height="130" align="right" />Big carrot says "Nonsense, just wait for a break in the traffic and run as fast as you can." Big carrot sees a break in the traffic and runs over to cabbage. He then calls to is friend to try. Little carrot gets ready, sees a break in the traffic and runs across the road. Unfortunately there was a big truck coming and little carrot gets squashed in the middle of the road. Big carrot feels really bad and scoops his friend up and takes him to the hospital. The doctors perform emergency surgery.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">After several hours the doctor comes out. "I have some good news and some bad news." Big carrot says "Ok doc, go ahead, I can take it."

So the rabbit went away. He came back the next morning, and again asked: "do you have any carrots?" And the clerk replied again: "Sorry, don't have any"<br />
This happened every morning for about a week. Then one morning, the clerk was getting a bit p****d off about the rabbit coming over every morning, so he said to the rabbit: "Now look, we don't sell any carrots here, you ask for carrots one more time, I'll nail you to the wall from your ears!"<br />
The rabbit stood still for a while, and went away.<br />
The next morning the rabbit came to the store again, and asked: "Do you have any nails?"<br />
The clerk was a bit confused, but replied: "No, I just run out of nails, sorry little fella."<br />
The rabbit: "Well do you have any carrots, then?"</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Answer - YES you have guessed it <b>- A CARROT</b>.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Now read on for the explanation or <a href="#puzzle2">click here</a> to go back.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Experiments carried out by university lecturers on students, psychologists on colleagues and teachers on pupils have shown that between 66% and 90% come up with the answer Carrot!!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Readers of the "New Scientist" are puzzling over why this should be. Random tests simply asking to name a vegetable came up with random answers. What is further intriguing is that many other answers when not carrot were orange or something orange!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Another experiment showed that 60% answered carrot and a further 20% answered cabbage.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">Extra data:</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font color="#000000">1.</font> The experiment doesn't work well on people who do not have English as their first language.<br />
2. A curiously common answer is "orange", or "something orange".<br />
3. If you do a similar experiment asking people to name a vegetable with no preamble, the response is fairly random with peas and potatoes being the most common.<br />
<br />
Favoured hypotheses:</font><br />
So why is that people say "carrot" when they are asked to name a vegetable after doing simple mental arithmetic. Here are some suggestions:<br />
<br />
1. "Carrot" sounds like "count/counting".<br />
2. The series of ever increasing numbers resembles a continuously increasing shape - like a carrot - although the "equals six" experiment would seem to discount this.<br />
3. The conceptual image of a carrot is the simplest mathematical/geometrical vegetable: a rotated triangle.<br />
4. "Carrot" is the most common vegetable, and therefore the one that most people are likely to think of when they're asked the question: "Name a vegetable."<br />
5. A "carrot" is the most distinctive vegetable because of its colour and shape, and it is what is scientifically known as a "cool" vegetable.<br />
6. The subjects are making an association of sounds between the vowel sound "a" in the word "maths", and the vowel sound "a" in the word "carrot". This would seem to be very logical because the word "cabbage", which was the second most popular choice of vegetable, also has the same vowel sound "a".<br />
7. There is some connection between the conceptual image of a carrot, and the geometrical shape formed by the sums. The ever-increasing series of numbers form a shape in the subjects' mind, which resembles a pyramid-type geometrical form, which is similar to a carrot.<br />
8. Carrots are also suggestive of a particular anatomical feature of the human body; and perhaps this is a case of the subconscious thought being expressed without censorship. There has been an in depth discussion on this phenomenon in the "New Scientist".
