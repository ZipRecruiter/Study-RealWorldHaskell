<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial" color="#0000FF">A page of particular relevance to Women and Carrots</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">Why Women should eat Carrots:</font> A high vitamin A and Beta Carotene content mean that the following problems often suffered by women can be helped through carrot consumption.</p>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial">Menorrhagia (abnormally heavy menstruation which can be caused by Vitamin A deficiency.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">Abnormal pap smears sometimes due to low levels of beta carotene and Vitamin A (as well as E and C)</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">Pre-menstrual Syndrome. Vitamin A increases progesterone levels which is believed to relieve this syndrome.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">Vaginitis, because the immunity boosting, antiviral and antibacterial properties of carrots can help fight some types of this ailment.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">Urinary Tract Infections, again Vitamin A is helpful in infection control.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">Osteoporosis, here the phytochemicals in carrots fight against this disease which particularly affects older women.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">Period Pain <a href="#Period%20Pain">click here</a></font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Beware during motherhood</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">People say that pregnant women should not eat carrots because they contain vitamin A and could induce malformations in the baby. Is this true? Doctors say no. Carrots are OK, but the vitamin supplements can be a factor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img src="gifs/womencar.gif" width="120" height="118" align="right" alt="carrot symbol" />Vitamin A is an important essential nutrient that you can get from certain foods and in multivitamins and supplements. In doses well over 10,000 units per day, vitamin A has been found to induce foetal malformations of the face and heart, and other problems. And in experimental animals, retinoids -- including vitamin A -- have produced defects involving the central nervous system, limbs and cardiovascular system, and behavioural abnormalities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Vegetables such as carrots contain provitamin A compounds called carotenoids, the most common of which is beta-carotene. When you eat carrots, your body converts only as much beta-carotene into vitamin A as it needs, so eating even a lot of beta-carotene-rich carrots will not increase the level of vitamin A in your blood.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The average healthy diet will not significantly raise your vitamin A level. But certain supplements contain much more than the safe daily dose limit of 10,000 international units (IU). If you take too much vitamin A in supplement form, or by ingesting certain foods that contain large amounts of it, such as liver, you could raise your blood level to the unhealthy range.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Most pre natal vitamin supplements contain 4,000 IU to 5,000 IU of vitamin A, which is about twice the recommended daily allowance (RDA) and less than half the safe maximum dose of 10,000 IU.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You could easily top 10,000 IU per day if you take additional supplements of high-dose vitamins or if you regularly eat liver, which contains on average of four to 12 times the RDA for vitamin A. Enriched foods such as fortified cereals or dairy products may also contain large doses of vitamin A.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">To keep from ingesting too much vitamin A, avoid supplements that are enriched with it before and during pregnancy, except for the prenatal vitamins recommended by your doctor or midwife.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Taken in wine, or boiled in wine and taken, the seeds help conception. Strangely enough the seeds made into a tea have been used for centuries as a contraceptive. Even the well-known fifth century physician/herbalist, Hippocrates prescribed it as an abortifacient. When herbal lore such as this survives the test of time, there is a good chance there is some truth behind it.&nbsp; <a href="cont.html#contraception" title="Click here to read all about the amazing contraceptive properties of Queen Anne's Lace">Click here to read more.</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Wondercup Breast Cream -</font> <font face="Arial" color="#000000">Many women use "Wondercup" breast cream.</font> <font face="Arial">Carrot was chosen as a chief ingredient of wondercup because: " It contains components with estrogenic activities, most notably beta carotene, which, like all phytoestrogens, is a substance similar to female hormones, and therefore able to regulate their production in the body, thus stimulating the natural development of the breast, the main receptor of estrogens in the female body."<br />
This property is confirmed by the traditional use of carrot as a stimulant to the production of mother's milk - indeed it acts on the breast by promoting the development of the mammary glands.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Cosmetic use</font> <font face="Arial">- Carrot has been regarded by the ancient healers as the 'herbal healer' of skin diseases. Indeed Vitamin A or betacarotene, of which carrot is rich, can be considered the main vitamins for the skin. Dry skin, with impurities, acne, difficulty in tanning, sunburns, eritema, premature appearance of wrinkles - all these things can depend largely on an insufficient intake of this vitamin.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Carrot is therefore very useful for the skin for its properties:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Anti-inflammatory</font><font face="Arial">, revitalizes and tones the skin. Used to treat dermatitis, eczema, rashes, as well as wrinkles (for its antioxidant properties which fight the damage to tissues caused by free radicals). Used also to promote the healing of cuts, abrasions and stubborn sores. Carrot seed diluted in wheatgerm oil is recommended as a suntan lotion. It is indeed used in some suncare lotions on the market. The underground part of carrot has anti-asthenic and anti-inflammatory properties and fights psoriasis.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Eye care</font> <font face="Arial">- From early childhood we are taught to eat carrots to improve our eyesight. Carrot brings relief of eyestrain and inflammation of the eyes.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Nourishing</font> <font face="Arial">- Carrot promotes healthy skin and is beneficial to areas of the skin that are regularly exposed to the sun and tend to blister and peel.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Moisturising</font> <font face="Arial">- Carrot aids in repair of skin tissue and helps in the treatment of dry, chapped and scaling skin conditions.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The fresh root, finely chopped, can be used as a beauty mask for the face.</font></p>

<p>Of the many health benefits of carrots, treating period pain efficiently is a major one. One of the worst and annoying time for women every month is when they are menstruating. It not just makes them uncomfortable but a few of them also experience extreme pain, making it difficult to carry on with their day-to-day activities. For such a condition carrots help provide relief. Among the several health benefits of carrots, treating period pain is a major one. The intensity of the pain may vary from one woman to another.</p>
<p>A few of them have extreme pain, a few have mild pain while a few others do not feel any pain at all. So what leads to this excruciating pain during periods? When the uterus contracts to expel its lining while menstruating, this leads to extreme pain in the lower abdomen. When the pain gets unbearable women take painkillers. This might provide immediate relief but popping in a painkiller every time you get the pain might not be healthy. It can cause a lot of side effects. So for such a condition natural remedies can help and carrot is one among them.</p>
<p>Here are a few reasons why women should make carrots a part of their diet especially when they are on their periods. Take a look at the health benefits of carrots and how to consume them.</p>
<p>1. Rich In Iron Content: Carrots are rich in iron content and are known to make up for the blood loss during periods. It not just helps in easing the pain but also helps to regularize the period flow.</p>
<p>2. Rich In Beta Carotene: One of the major contents in carrot is the beta carotene. The beta carotene converts into vitamin A that is helpful in controlling the blood flow and thus minimizes the pain.</p>
<p>3. Rich In Fibre: Carrots contain unique fibres that help in detoxifying the body and ease the blood flow and pain during menstruation.</p>
<p>Ways to consume carrots when you have menstrual pain:</p>
<p>Carrot Juice: Take one or two fresh carrots, peel them, cut them into pieces and then put them in a juicer and then blend them well. Drink this juice twice a day. It helps ease menstrual pain.</p>
