<p>What has become truly amazing to the World Carrot Museum team is that once the site became firmly established with a web presence then what quickly followed was the connections with different people from all over the world who all have a passing interest in carrots or who are serious collectors. In most cases it can only be described as sheer carrot madness!<br />
<br />
The Museum staff thank the contributors for their efforts in making the site even more interesting and absorbing, both to write and read.</p>
<p>There appears to be no end to "carrotabilia" which can be collected. Plates, teapots, pitchers, carrot scrapers, key rings, fridge magnets, corkscrews, knifes, badges, Christmas ornaments, jewellery etc etc. <a href="collectibles.html">Click here</a> to view some samples of items which people have collected once carrot madness takes hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Picture, right, shows the Carrot Museum Curator and Keeper in one of the carrot costumes in the collection. This "disguise" is one of a kind.</p>
<p><img vspace="8" width="107" height="70" src="photos/tattoo3.jpg" alt="carrot tattoo" align="left" />On a more unusual tangent there are people who have been carrot tattooed and those who collect carrot bags. Those who have dared to come forward have been allocated their own unique page in the World Carrot Museum and have become firm friends of the site. In fact quite a community of carrot maniacs has grown with e-mail, letters, parcels and exchanging pleasantries as we all exercise and exhibit our carrot madness in our own unique and special way. Pictured above (right) and below right, John the Carrot Museum Curator.</p>
