<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Carrots are grown all over the world and are readily available in all seasons. They vary in colour from orange, purple, black, pinkish, red, yellow and white.<font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="photos/blueskyphoto.jpg" width="229" height="297" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="8" /></font> This delicious vegetable is within the reach of rich &amp; poor alike and is rightly called the "universal root". The carrot root is the main edible part and can be eaten raw, drunk as a juice, used in every conceivable salad, cooked as a vegetable, &nbsp;made into jam, marmalade, syrup &amp; sweet dishes. You can also eat the greens tops.&nbsp;Read more <a target="_blank" href="carrotops.html">here</a>.<br /></font><br />
The Carrot is a very versatile vegetable and can be used in a myriad of savoury and sweet dishes, mostly very healthy eating and good alternatives to stodge. It can be used as a starter, main course, sweet or just as a snack. Carrots may be eaten raw or cooked in almost any manner imaginable.<br />
<br />
Carrots help to maintain acidic &amp; alkaline properties in the system it is an invigorating &amp; energizing tonic for eyes, skin, bones, heart &amp; muscles of the body. Carrot is blood purifier, diuretic, carminative, digestive, anti flatulent, anti pyretic and vermifuge.<br />
<a href="nutrition.html">Check out the nutrition page for full details.</a><br />
<br />
Carrots can be eaten sliced, diced, cut up or shoe stringed. They are sold in bunches, canned, frozen and dehydrated. They may be baked, saut�ed, pickled, glazed and served in combination with meats, stews, roasts, soups meat loaf or curries. The mineral contents in carrots lie very close to the skin. Hence they should not be peeled or scraped off.</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Dried roasted carrot roots can be ground into a powder and used as coffee substitute. Carrot syrup is sometimes employed as a sweetening agent. Alcoholic tincture of carrot seed is incorporated in French liqueurs. Carrot oil is used for flavouring and in perfumery. Considerable honey is manufactured from bees visiting carrot, although the quality is poor. The flower clusters can be french-fried to produce a carrot-flavoured gourmet's delight. The aromatic seed is used as a flavouring in stews etc.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>VERSATILITY OF CARROTS � are one of the most versatile Vegetables in the World</b></font></font></p>
<center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3">Good in savoury or sweet dishes, raw or cooked, carrots are extremely versatile and while they're delicious lightly boiled and served with butter and seasoning, there's no need to stop there! Simply wash in cold water and they are ready to eat or cook with. No need to peel or top and tail.</font></font></p>
<center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Raw</b> Carrots can be eaten just as they are and are particularly popular with children because of their sweet crunchiness and small size. They can be served halved or whole as crudit�s with other vegetables and a dip.</font></font></p>
<center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Juice</b> Naturally sweet Carrots make delicious juice. Bear in mind that to make enough juice for one you'll need around 5 large carrots. Try juicing Carrots with ginger and/or apple or orange to make a delicious and nutritious drink.</font></font></p>
<center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Boiled</b> Cover thickly sliced Carrots in boiling water and add a pinch of salt if you like. Simmer for five minutes or until they are just tender which you can test with the point of a sharp knife. Serve with melted butter, chopped parsley and season to taste</font></font></p>
<center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Steamed</b> Steaming is more gentle than boiling and allows the Carrots to keep their colour, flavour and texture. Place sliced Carrots in a steamer over a pan of simmering water and put the lid on. Steam for five minutes or until the carrots are tender. Try serving with toasted sesame seeds or pine nuts.</font></font></p>
<center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Roasted</b> Toss chunky chopped Carrots in olive oil, sea salt and black pepper and herbs or spices to taste. Try cumin or chopped thyme and experiment to create your own favourites. Arrange the carrots in a single layer in a roasting tin and place in the oven at 190c 375f for 20-30 minutes or until the carrots are tender, slightly browned and caramelised.</font></font></p>
<center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Baked</b> Wrap 3 inch strips of whole carrots in foil with a couple of tablespoons of wine, a knob of butter, a handful of fresh, chopped herbs and a pinch of salt, leaving them plenty of room to move. Put the parcel on a baking tray and bake for 40 minutes at 220c 425f. Drain the liquid off and sprinkle with chopped parsley to serve.</font></font></p>
<center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Stir fried</b> Cut Carrots lengthwise into halves or quarters and cut your other vegetables to similar sizes. Try spring onions, peppers and courgettes. Heat a small amount of oil in a wok over a high heat, add the vegetables and cook for a short time, stirring periodically, but not constantly. Add grated ginger, chopped garlic, chopped chillies and coriander to taste. Finish with a splash of soy sauce, a squeeze of lime and a drizzle of sesame oil.</font></font></p>
<center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>In salad</b> Carrots work well in salads either sliced or grated, and can be included either raw, roasted or blanched. Try a fresh dressing of lemon, olive oil and chopped shallots to contrast the sweetness of the Carrots.</font></font></p>
<center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Microwaved</b> Place sliced Carrots in a microwaveable dish with a couple of tablespoons of water. Cover with cling film, pierce and microwave for five minutes or until they are just tender</font></font></p>
<center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Chargrilled</b> Slice Carrots lengthwise into 5mm thick slices. Blanch briefly in boiling water (bring to the boil, simmer for a minute or so and plunge into cold water). Drain the carrot slices, toss in a little olive oil and seasoning and place on a hot, ridged griddle pan until they are marked on one side then turn and repeat.</font></font></p>
<center>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3">The French word Crecy (pronounced kray-cee) indicates that carrots are being used in a dish. A la Crecy refers to a French garnish made of julienned carrots (matchstick shape) or more generally a French method of preparation In which carrots are used. Consomme Crecy is a rich beef broth garnished with julienne carrots. Crecy is a village in France, which once produced carrots famous for their fine quality. Carrottes a la Vichy is a French dish of carrots cooked in Vichy water, from the town of Vichy.</font></font></p>

<hr color="#FFA500" size="4" />
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Selection of Carrots in the store</b> - Bigger is not better when it comes to carrots so select carrots that are less than 8 inches long and relatively uniform in shape and size.&nbsp; They should be well shaped, firm, and smooth with no cracks. Purchase carrots with a smooth and firm surface. They should not look wilted. If buying carrots with their greenery, make sure the leaves are moist and bright green; the carrots should be bright, firm and smooth. The deeper the colour, the more beta-carotene contained in the carrot.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3">The bright green tops don't guarantee a fresher carrot; however, it is widely assumed that they are fresher than the carrots sold in plastic bags.&nbsp; Remove carrot greenery as soon as possible because it robs the roots of moisture and vitamins. Avoid those which are dry with cracks or any that have begun to soften and wither. The best carrots are young and slender. Carrots should feel heavy, not bend at all and when grated should be quite juicy. The more orange they look, the more beta-carotene they contain.<br />
<br />
When buying them, look for vibrantly coloured bunches of firm, well-shaped carrots with bright-green tops. If the tops are shrivelled, then you know the carrots are old. Of course, carrots are often sold with the tops removed. To judge the freshness in this case, inspect the stem end for darkening, a sure sign it's been around awhile. Whether loose or in plastic bags, avoid carrots with green shoots sprouting out (not to be confused with their green tops) yellowed tips, soft spots or withering. All are a sign of age. Also avoid carrots with large green areas at or near their tops. This indicates sunburn damage on the vegetable. Carrots which an excessive amount of new sprouts or leaves could have large or woody cores.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3">Tiny baby carrots are very tender and sweeter but, because of their lack of maturity, not as flavourful as their full-grown siblings. Store carrots in a plastic bag in the refrigerator's vegetable bin. Avoid storing them near fruit, particularly apples and pears, which emit ethylene gas as they ripen that can give carrots a bitter taste and decrease the storage life of carrots and other vegetables. &nbsp;Also keep away from peaches. A light<img src="gifs/2prong.gif" width="60" height="59" align="right" alt="twin carrot" /> rinsing is all that's necessary for young carrots and tiny baby carrots; older carrots can be peeled if necessary but remember much of the goodness is in the skin.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3">If carrots have become limp or dehydrated, re-crisp them in a bowl of ice water for about half an hour. Firm up limp carrots by cutting off one of the ends and sticking the carrots in ice water, cut side down. The coarse core of older carrots should be removed.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3">Before storing carrots, remove their green tops, rinse, drain, and put the carrots in plastic bags and store them in the coldest part of the refrigerator with the highest humidity. They'll last several months this way. To keep the carrots crisp and colourful add a little bit of water in the bottom of the plastic storage bag; this will keep the carrots hydrated. Carrots should be stored away from fruits such as apples and pears, which release the ethylene gas that cause carrots to become bitter. <span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial"><a href="EthylenePDF.pdf">Read more here</a> (pdf)</span></font></font></p>

<br />
2 whole wheat pitas, 2 carrots, shredded, 1cup muenster cheese, garlic powder, oregano and black pepper.<br />
<br />
Preheat toaster oven to 300 F. Distribute carrots evenly on the concave side of whole pita. Distribute cheese on top of carrots. Top with loads of garlic powder, a dash of oregano and pepper. Bake in toaster oven about 15 min. Serve and eat.</p>

<p><b>Carrot<a name="pesto"></a> Pesto</b> Ingredients</p>
<p>2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped, , cup roasted cashews, 1 clove garlic, � cup olive oil, Salt, to taste</p>
<p>Directions</p>
<p>Place carrots, cashews and garlic in food processor, and pulse until coarse. As machine runs, add oil in steady stream until pesto becomes mostly smooth. Add salt, to taste. Makes about 1 cup.</p>

<p><a name="fudge"></a><b>Carrot Fudge</b></p>
<p>If you love carrot cake, you'll love this recipe!</p>
<p>Yields 1 pound.</p>
<p>1 1/2 cups peeled and grated young carrots 3 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk 1/2 cup water 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract 1/2 cup chopped walnuts</p>
<p>Butter upper sides of a 3-quart saucepan; measure all ingredients except lemon extract and nuts into the saucepan. Grease and line a 12 x 5-inch pan. Put 1/2 inch of water into the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>Dissolve the sugar, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon over low heat until the spoon glides smoothly over the bottom of the pan. Increase heat to medium and bring to a boil.</p>
<p>Wash down any crystals that may have formed with a pastry brush dipped in hot water, using as little water as possible. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan. Reduce heat while retaining boil. Stir no more than necessary. Test is ice water when mixture thickens and bubbles become noisy. A ball, formed in ice water, should hold its shape until heat from your hand begins to flatten it, and it should be slightly chewy. The temperature will be approximately 234 degrees F to 240 degrees F.</p>
<p>Remove saucepan from heat and place it in the sink. Add lemon extract without stirring, then allow the fudge to cool.</p>
<p>Stir when lukewarm and skin forms on top (110 degrees F). Stir fudge thoroughly but not vigorously either by hand or with an electric mixer. Pause frequently to allow fudge to react. Watch for fudge to thicken, lose its sheen, become light in color or streaked with lighter shades, give off some heat, and suddenly stiffen. If mixing by hand, fudge will "snap" with each stroke; by mixer, mixer waves will become very distinct; by food processor, fudge will flow sluggishly back to center when processor is stopped. If the fudge candies too quickly, just spoon it out and knead it with your hands. Add nuts before fudge totally candies.</p>
<p>Pour, score and store when cool in airtight container in refrigerator or at room temperature.</p>
<p>This recipe is easily doubled and can be frozen.</p>

Ingredients (18 servings)<br />
10 Carrots, peeled and cut into chunks; 2 tablespoons Oil; 3 Garlic cloves, minced; 3 Onions, cut into chunks; 2 Celery stalks, diced; 2 Green peppers, diced; 5 tablespoons Tamari; 1/2 teaspoon Garlic powder; 1/2 teaspoon Basil; 1/2 ts Paprika; 1/2 ts Oregano;<br />

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#000000">2 cups whole milk<br />
1 cup heavy cream<br />
1/2 cup green pistachios<br />
2 cups carrot juice<br />
2 cups sugar<br />
one table spoon flour</font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#000000">Combine the milk and sugar and set to boil in a deep pan. Ladle half a cup of the milk into a cup while not yet warm, and dissolve the flour in it. Add the dissolved flour mixture to the pan. The flour will thicken the milk and is a good substitute for eggs. (Eggs in ice cream raise the problems of salmonella from undercooking and an eggy smell. Furthermore, some people don't eat eggs. So, flour is a great substitute. Cornflour may be used, but I find that regular flour works better.) Stir the milk a few times with a spoon. Chop the pistachios and add to the milk. While chopping, some pieces may crumble to a powder. That is good. The powdered nuts will only make the ice cream thicker. Add the heavy cream and boil some more. Over all, the milk should be boiled for about 35 minutes. Switch off the flame. Allow milk mixture to cool. Add cold carrot juice and place the entire mixture in the refrigerator to cool.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#000000">After it is cooled, pour into the ice cream container and make ice cream as per instructions of your ice cream machine. When ice cream is ready, spoon into a plastic tub and place in freezer for about 15 minutes to firm up some more. Serve scoops in bowls, garnished with additional pistachios if you wish.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#000000">Optional ingredients: The ice cream can be made more interesting by adding half a tea spoon of saffron strands to the milk mixture at the same time that you add the chopped pistachios. Also, by adding powdered cardomom powder to the milk at the beginning of the recipe. Golden raisins are also optional--may be added into the ice cream machine, or boiled in the milk, depending on your preference.</font></font></font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#000000">2 cups carrot slices; 2 cups half-and-half; 2 cups heavy cream; 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise; 2 wide strips orange rind; 1 cinnamon stick; 9 egg yolks; 3/4 cup sugar</font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#000000">Method<br />
In small saucepan, boil carrot slices in water until very tender. Drain, then make puree and reserve. In saucepan over medium heat, whisk together half-and-half, cream, vanilla, orange rind and cinnamon stick, stirring to make sure mixture doesn't burn or stick to bottom of pan. When cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off heat and let flavours infuse 10 minutes.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#000000">Whisk egg yolks and sugar together. In thin stream, whisk half of cream mixture into egg yolk mixture. Then pour egg-cream mixture back into saucepan containing rest of cream mixture. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with wooden spoon. At 160 degrees, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When mixture reaches 180 degrees it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. If you do not have a thermometer, test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#000000">Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough. When it is ready, quickly remove from heat.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in a bowl put 2 handfuls of ice cubes in bottom, and add cold water to cover. Rest a smaller bowl in the ice water. Combine the carrot puree with the custard, mixing well. Pour the cream mixture through a fine sieve (to remove vanilla bean pieces, orange rind and cinnamon sticks) into smaller bowl. Chill 3 hours, then continue according to ice-cream maker directions.</font></font></font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#000000">Some dehydrating sites say you do not have to blanch carrots before drying. It is recommended that you do blanch carrots before dehydrating. Why? Because you get better results. Blanching stops enzyme action that causes loss of colour, texture and flavour. In dehydrating it also shortens the drying and re-hydration time, keeps dried veggies fresh for longer, and kills micro-organisms that could induce spoilage.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#000000">The Colorado State University Extension Office says this about blanching:</font></font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#000000"><i>Pre-treating vegetables by blanching in boiling water or citric acid solution is recommended to enhance the quality and safety of the dried vegetables. Blanching helps slow or stop the enzyme activity that can cause undesirable changes in flavour and texture during storage. Blanching also relaxes tissues so pieces dry faster, helps protect the vitamins and colour and reduces the time needed to refresh vegetables before cooking. In addition, research studies have shown that pre-treating vegetables by blanching in water or citric acid solution enhances the destruction of potentially harmful bacteria during drying, including Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella species and Listeria monocytogenes.</i></font></font></font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#000000">Carrot chips are a new and improved version of potato chips. The concept is the same: the root vegetable is washed, sliced, and fried or baked until it is crisp. It can be salted or seasoned much like a potato chip can. Carrot chips, in fact, look much like deep orange potato chips.<br />
<br />
Unlike potato chips, however, carrot chips are rich in Vitamin A, an essential part of a healthy diet. Fried carrot chips, like potato chips, can contain a large amount of fat. However, there are many health-food companies that offer baked carrot chips that contain all of the great vitamins, but a nominal amount of fat.<br />
<img border="0" src="photos/chips.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="300" /><br />
With health consciousness on the rise, people are always looking for better ways to eat. Snacking, it has been found, is a big reason why people gain weight; weight gain, of course, can lead to all kinds of circulatory and skeletal problems and can result in obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, many snack foods such as potato chips are full of fat and calories, but offer little nutrition. Therefore, choosing healthy snack foods like baked carrot chips can be very important to one�s health.<br />
<br />
Interested in making your own baked carrot chips for a healthy snack? Here�s a great recipe:<br />
<br />
1. Spray a baking sheet with a light coat of oil.<br />
2. Slice your desired number of carrots into rounds that are 1/4 inch (2.54 cm) thick.<br />
3. Place the slices on the baking sheet without overlapping them.<br />
4. Season to taste with salt and pepper.<br />
5. Place the baking sheet in an oven, preheated in 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius).<br />
6. Bake the carrot chips for approximately five minutes, or until the edges turn brown.<br />
7. Turn the chips and back for another 5-10 minutes.<br />
8. Enjoy!<br />
<br />
Carrot chips may, in fact, become a very important food in some developing countries University of Nebraska Scientists Ahmad Sulaeman and Judy Driskell have been working with carrot chip recipes. They believe that carrot chips might help to combat vitamin deficiencies in children who are growing up in impoverished circumstances. These scientists are working with deep fried carrot chips. Because people in developing countries have a hard time getting enough calories as well as vitamins, the fat content in deep friend carrot chips is not a concern. In fact, the extra calories can be quite important to their diet. Unlike baked carrot chips, deep fried carrot chips can contain over 50% fat.<br />

3 large eggs (yes, 3!)<br />
3/4 cup olive oil<br />
(you can also add 1/2 cup toasted pecans or walnuts if desired)</font></font></p>

Preheat oven to 350.<br />
Combine everything in a bowl. Should be a very liquid, sweet dough. If it doesn�t look liquid, add a splash of milk, or more oil.<br />
Grease or line the muffin cups.<br />
Pour batter into a pan with 12 muffin cups. (This is enough batter for 18 small ones, but you want 12 enormous ones with tops!)<br />
Bake for 20-25 minutes at 350 degrees or until you can stick a fork in and it comes out clean.<br />
Cool until completely cool, and ease out gently with a knife. EAT! </font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial">The basic rule of this diet is to add a carrot at or near the beginning of every meal. Why should this work? This works because a bulky carrot at or near the meal's beginning leaves <img src="gifs/fivefruit.gif" width="137" height="138" alt="five fruits a day" align="left" />no room in the stomach at the meal's end for the extra ice-cream or cheesecake. That saves perhaps 500 calories a day, which translates to a weight loss of about a pound a week. Even plain water at the beginning of a meal will tend to create a full feeling in the stomach sooner in the meal. This will reduce the amount of food consumed at the end. But eating carrot is more fun.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial">Getting your carrot-a-day is easy, considering the vegetable's versatility and blendability. And subtlety: carrots enhance but don't overwhelm. Here are ways to put power on your table.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial">Cook grated carrots with beans, split peas, lentils, rice, pastas. Good in stuffing. Try them roasted - split large carrots lengthways and brush with a little oil then put on a roasting tray &nbsp;in a 200c oven for about 45 minutes until tender and browned. Try roast carrots, potato, sweet potato and pumpkin serve with steamed green vegetables and a nice sauce.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial">Toss grated carrot with potatoes for hashbrowns. (Toss in grated zucchini and minced onion, too.)</font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Add to sauces</font><font face="Arial">, white or red.

According to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, October 1985, carrot juice can pull these heavy metals from fatty tissue where they reside, bind them up, and discharge them from the system.</font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3">Carrot juice, because of its many healthy benefits, is frequently called the "miracle juice." A large number of people in all walks of life suffering from various ailments have found that the inclusion of carrot juice in their diet has greatly improved their health. Countless others have found it to be a valuable "protective" agent in the building and maintenance of health in both children and adults, while its delicious flavour makes it popular with all members of the family as a beverage, plain or combined with other juices.</font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;Carrot juice is a very important source of vitamin A. Scientists in the U.S. estimate that this juice contains the largest source of vitamin A, than any other fruit juice. Carrot juice provides an important source of dietary fibre and has approximately 24 calories in each 2 oz. Serving. It contains important nutrients such as calcium, phosphorous, iron, sodium, potassium, vitamin B complex, vitamin A, and as mentioned - mostly vitamin A.</font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3">Carrot juice is a therapeutic agent used for over 150 years as an ancient practice. It is <img src="gifs/2prong.gif" width="60" height="59" align="right" alt="twin carrot" />reported to contain healing properties that have proven to treat varied diseases. Even complexion problems can be eliminated with the intake and digestion of needed potassium in carrot juice to help neutralize excess acid to the skin. The vitamin A in carrot juice helps the liver flush out toxins from the body - toxins that cause complexion problems.</font></font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>Fresh juice</strong> has the ability to distribute an additional significant variety of nutrients, recognized as enzymes, which are your body's labour power. Performing as catalysts in hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions that occur throughout your body, enzymes are crucial for digestion and amalgamation of food, for conversion of food packs into body tissue, and for the creation of energy at the cellular level. In fact, enzymes are vital for most of the metabolic actions taking position in your body every second of every day.</font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3">Fresh juices are a wonderful resource of enzymes. The freshness of juice is one of their key features, since enzymes are damaged by high temperature. Given that fruits and vegetables are juiced uncooked, the enzymes are still there when you drink the juice!</font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3">Fruit and vegetable juices are also excellent sources of the traditional nutrients. Citrus fruits (grapefruit, oranges, etc.) are packed with vitamin C. Carrot juice contains vitamin A, in the form of beta-carotene. Green juices are excellent sources of vitamin E. Fruit juices are also a source of essential minerals like iron, copper, potassium, sodium, iodine, and magnesium, which are most easily assimilated throughout digestion.</font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3">Since juicing eliminates the hard to digest fibre, nutrients are obtainable to the body in a great deal of larger quantities than if the piece of fruit or vegetable was eaten whole. For instance, since a lot of the nutrients are in the fibre, <b>when you eat a raw carrot, you are only able to absorb about 1% of the beta-carotene. When a carrot is juiced, eliminating the fibre, virtually 100% of the beta-carotene may be assimilated.</b></font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3">Fruits and vegetables offer another substance that is completely fundamental for good health - water. Over 65% of most of the cells in the human body are made of water, and in some tissues, such as the brain, the cells may be made up of as much as 80% water. Water is extremely necessary for good health, yet most people don't consume enough water each day. Fruit and vegetable juices are free of unnecessary substances and are bursting with pure, clean water.</font></font></font></p>

Avoid "baby carrots", also make sure you use all of the carrot. Many take off their skins, where most of the goodness lies. Make sure you drink it as soon as possible as it does not keep well. Best made and drunk fresh.</font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3">1. Wash fresh, whole carrots. Trim off the ends.<br />
2. Following instructions for your model, push carrots through juicer, catching juice in cup as directed.<br />
3. Clean pulp from strainer as you go along, if necessary.<br />
4. Drink juice immediately or within a few days. Carrot juice does not keep for long and tastes best when fresh</font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Preparing Carrots for Juicing.</font> Wash carrots thoroughly in cold water, using a stiff vegetable brush. Scrape lightly, but do not peel, as valuable vitamins and minerals lies close to the surface. The juice should be taken immediately it is made, if at all possible. If not, let the juice flow directly into glass jars which should then be covered with screw-on lids. After pouring the quantity to be used immediately, keep the remaining juice tightly covered, in the refrigerator to prevent loss of vitamin and mineral content through oxidation.</font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3">Carrot juice blends with practically all other juices. It is a delicious nourishing beverage for all members of the family at all times and it should be an important part of the diet in cases of illness. One pound of carrots will make approximately six to eight ounces of carrot juice. The large, firm, dark-yellow carrots should be selected for juicing, rather than the light-yellow ones, because of their greater carotene content.</font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3">It�s also important to add a good squeeze of lemon juice, you won�t really notice the taste of it and it will stop the apple juice from oxidising and turning the whole thing a muddy brown colour. Oxidisation won�t affect the taste, but it�s nicer if your fresh juice doesn�t look like pond water.<br />

Yes, <b>you can freeze carrot juice</b>, but:<br />
1. It will be very thin and separated when thawed (so you can use it for cooking, for an ingredient in salad dressing, etc, but not so great for drinking)<br />
2. It may pick up flavours in the freezer, so be certain to wrap it very tightly.<br />
3. A small amount of nutritional value will be lost.<br />
4. There is no need to blanche the carrots first, just make juice as normal in a juicer.<br />
5. It should last a month, but it's never as good as fresh.</font></font></font></p>

<br />
This carrot juice drink, made mostly on Sundays, is the crowned king of Jamaican dinner juices. This is one of the methods used to make this juice.<br />
Ingredients:<br />
2lbs. Carrot<br />
1 can Condensed Milk<br />
� lb Sugar<br />
2 tablespoon nutmeg<br />
2 tablespoon vanilla flavouring<br />
3 cups water<br />
Tools:<br />
Electric Blender<br />
Fine grain strainer<br />
Wash the carrots to remove any dirt or foreign matter, then cut the carrots into tiny pieces, let us say 1/8 inch (please, do not measure the pieces just estimate).<br />
Put carrots into the Electric Blender one handful at a time until the Blender is � ways full, each time. Add about � cup of water to the carrots in the Blender. Turn the Blender switch to puree and allow carrots to process until they are ground to a pulp.<br />
Remove pulp and place into a large mixing bowl. Add 1 cup water to pulp. Using your clean hand, squeeze the pulp in your palm, allowing the juice to flow through the strainer.<br />
Put the squeezed pulp on a plate to the side. Repeat this process until all the pulp is squeezed. Add water to the squeezed pulp that you put on a plate earlier, in a mixing bowl.<br />
Squeeze this pulp again. Drain carrot juice into another container through the strainer so as to stop any remaining pulp from getting into the final product.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="3">Mix in the condensed milk with the carrot juice, add sugar to taste. Add nutmeg and vanilla flavouring. You can add more water or more ingredients if you like, to bring about the taste you desire. Add a capful of white rum to the mixture to enhance the flavour!<br />

In fact it has been available on supermarket shelves for years. You will find cans of carrot juice where other canned fruit and vegetable juices are. And although a freshly "squeezed" glass of carrot juice made in a juicer may seem like it's better for you, the canned juice has no preservatives, no added ingredients, and every bit as much beta-carotene as the fresh stuff.</font></font></font></font></p>

Add carrot juice to orange juice, tomato juice, pineapple juice, apricot nectar, beet juice. It's not just the flavours that will surprise you, but the vivid colours you can mix up. Or make a smoothie: Consider a blend of peaches, vanilla yoghurt, carrot juice, a pinch of nutmeg and a splash of almond extract. Or orange juice, carrot juice, banana yoghurt, and a few drops of vanilla...you get the idea?. (Feeling wicked? Add a splash of vodka, a squirt of grenadine and a dash of lime juice to your cupful of carrot juice and top with a mint sprig.)</font></font></font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">Do your Carrots Turn green in your cakes??<br /></font> Have you heard of the situation where carrot shreds in carrot cake turn bright green after baking. Some cooks think this is crazy. Do you know what circumstances produce the colour change? &nbsp;Is it the sequence ingredients are added, the type of oven (gas vs. electric) used? People seem to either be familiar with the colour change or deny that it happens. Any ideas?<br />
Answers so far - it could be a reaction to the baking soda. You may try this experiment next time: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Put your shredded carrots in a fine mesh colander, and dip it in the boiling water for 5-10 seconds, and then straight in to ice water (to stop the cooking process). Now they are blanched, and are less sensitive to chemical reactions.<br />
<br />
OR Sometimes cakes will turn greenish if left to cool in a metal pan. This is due to the oxidisation of the metal, and can be prevented by turning the cake out onto a cooling rack after about 10 minutes. We have heard of carrots turning green when bought in packages pre-grated. This could also be due to oxidization. You might try peeling your carrots first, before grating them.<br />
<br />
OR The colour change in your carrots is probably because they have been mixed or baked in a metal pan. Some aluminium and stainless steel dishes can cause the carrots to oxidise and turn green. Use a glass bowl to mix, and line metal baking pans with parchment.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">OR</font> It is simply oxidisation. Sometimes it may also cause a reaction when mixed in an aluminium or stainless steel bowl or even when baked in an aluminium pan. If that's the case, you could just mix it in a glass bowl and line your pan with parchment. It may be even a reaction from the baking soda/powder. Carrots naturally turn green if even left out, especially uncooked shreds.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">OR</font> <span lang="EN-US">Make sure to peel all of your carrots before shredding them and you won't have bits of green in your cake!</span></p>
<p align="left">Baking soda can have an effect on the colour of fruits. Baking soda is chemically classified as a base - above 7 pH- in order to work, baking soda must be combined with an acid-below 7 pH- (high school chemistry). Too much baking soda made blueberries turn greyish-green. If you replace the baking soda with cream of tartar (an acid),&nbsp; the cream of tartar makes the blueberries turn more of a magenta colour.&nbsp; So maybe the same with carrots?</p>

<p align="left"><b>Marzipan carrots</b> are easy to make, and look adorable on top of carrot cake or cupcakes! You can <img border="0" src="photos/marzipancarrots.jpg" align="right" width="127" height="97" />modify the recipe and vary the size of the carrots to suit your needs.<br />
You can make your own marzipan, or purchase it from most large grocery stores. Marzipan most commonly comes in 7-ounce tubes (the quantity called for here) but you can use more or less depending on what you have available.<br />
<br />
<i><b>Ingredients:</b></i><br />
� 7 ounces (1 roll) marzipan, Red and yellow food colouring, Powdered sugar for dusting, Edible sprigs of herbs for decoration (optional).<br />
<br />
<i><b>Preparation:</b></i><br />
1. Coat your hands with powdered sugar, or wear plastic gloves.<br />
2. Knead the marzipan until it has softened slightly. Flatten the marzipan into a disc, and add a few drops of red and yellow food colouring to the middle, using a ratio of 1 drop red to 2 drops yellow. Fold the marzipan into a ball and begin to knead the colour throughout the dough, adding more food colouring if desired, working until the marzipan is one uniform colour.<br />
3. Roll the dough into small balls the size of a quarter. Roll the balls between your palms, elongating them into thin tubes and tapering one end, so that they are shaped like carrots.<br />
4. Take a toothpick and, holding it perpendicular to the carrots, make horizontal indentations all along the length of the toothpick to create slight creases.<br />
5. If desired, poke holes in the tops of the carrots, and insert the sprigs of herbs to be the carrot leaves.<br />
6. Store marzipan carrots in an airtight Tupperware container for up to two weeks, or freeze well-wrapped marzipan carrots for up to three months.<br />
