<hr />
<p>Carrot cultivars can be grouped into two broad classes, eastern carrots and western carrots. A number of novelty cultivars have been bred for particular characteristics.</p>
<p>"Eastern" (a European and American continent reference) carrots were domesticated in Persia (probably in the lands of modern-day Iran and Afghanistan within West Asia) during the 10th century, or possibly earlier. Specimens of the "eastern" carrot that survive to the present day are commonly purple or yellow, and often have branched roots. The purple colour common in these carrots comes from anthocyanin pigments.</p>
<p>"Western" carrot cultivars are commonly classified by their root shape. The four general types are:</p>
<p><b>Chantenay carrots.</b> Although the roots are shorter than other cultivars, they have vigorous foliage and greater girth, being broad in the shoulders and tapering towards a blunt, rounded tip. They store well, have a pale-coloured core and are mostly used for processing. Cultivars include 'Korodo', 'Carson Hybrid' and 'Red Cored Chantenay'.</p>
<p><b>Danvers carrots.</b> These have strong foliage and the roots are longer than Chantaney types, and they have a conical shape with a well-defined shoulder, tapering to a point. They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing. They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts. Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'.</p>
<p><b>Imperator carrots.</b> This cultivar has vigorous foliage, is of high sugar content, and has long and slender roots, tapering to a pointed tip. Imperator types are the most widely cultivated by commercial growers. Cultivars include Yellowstone 'Imperator 58' and 'Sugarsnax Hybrid'.</p>
<p><b>Nantes carrots.</b> These have sparse foliage, are cylindrical, short with a more blunt tip than Imperator types, and attain high yields in a range of conditions. The skin is easily damaged and the core is deeply pigmented. They are brittle, high in sugar and store less well than other types. Cultivars include 'Nelson Hybrid', 'Scarlet Nantes' and 'Sweetness Hybrid'.</p>

<td>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF8040"><b>Flyaway</b></font> - The result of over 15 years breeding, this is we believe the closest to being a completely carrot fly resistant variety. In recent trials it came out top when grown against over 20 other 'resistant' varieties. Its resistance lies in it having low levels of chlorogenic acid, a chemical which the larvae of the carrot fly needs for survival. This means that it appears to be unattractive to the fly and even if your crop is attacked to some degree the larvae will soon die after doing relatively little damage. A Nantes type with cylindrical roots and a good blunt end and, perhaps most importantly, they are succulent and sweet. This variety is based on original breeding work carried out by Dr Bob Ellis and sponsored by MAFF funding.</font></p>
