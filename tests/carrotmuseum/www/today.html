<p>Brief history <a href="history.html">(full history starts here)</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Daucus carota is a variable, widespread species naturally distributed from the Atlantic coast of Britain and Ireland through Europe and the Mediterranean to Central Asia. It is recognisable by its highly divided, carrot-scented, fern-like leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers, arranged in parasols, arising from a nest of finely divided bracts. Underground, wild carrot has a small, tough, highly branched, white taproot. In contrast, cultivated carrots have swollen, unbranched taproots in a rainbow of colours: purple, yellow, red, white, orange and black.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are two classes of pigments in carrots: water-soluble, purple anthocyanins and oil-soluble carotenes. Anthocyanins are powerful antioxidants; carotenes are essential sources of vitamin A. Without sufficient vitamin A we are likely to suffer visual problems such as night blindness. Purple carrots are rich in carotenes but their colours are masked by the anthocyanins; when boiled purple carrots turn brown. In contrast, xanthophyll-rich, yellow carrots retain their colour when cooked. In addition to colour, other differences among the multitude of carrot types include the shape, size, sweetness and bitterness.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Classical writers were aware of the medicinal and culinary possibilities of carrots but did not clearly distinguish them from parsnips. Today, there is little chance of confusing bright orange carrots with ivory coloured parsnips. Despite the confusion, classical authors made clear distinctions between taproots from cultivated (manured) and wild plants; the former made good food, whilst the latter were preferred as medicine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Historical and genetic data indicate domesticated carrots originated in Central Asia. In the early twentieth century, the Soviet geneticist Nicolai Vavilov was emphatic: in Central Asia the 'wild carrots � practically invited themselves to be cultivated'. Modern carrots were selected from wild carrots in the east of the species' range. Their ubiquity across Europe is due to the spread of cultivated carrots not separate domestication events wherever wild carrots were found in Europe. During the tenth and eleventh centuries cultivated carrot spread into Asia Minor and the Iberian Peninsula. In the fourteenth century, the cultivated carrot spread through northwest Europe and finally entered Britain in the fifteenth century.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During the seventeenth century, the kaleidoscope of carrot colours in Western Europe was gradually reduced to one and European carrots became stereotypically orange. The origin of the orange mutant has provoked extensive discussion. Detailed investigation of genetic diversity across many different forms of wild and cultivated yellow, purple and orange carrots has concluded categorically that orange carrots were selected from yellow, cultivated carrots. <i>(source - Reference - A high-quality carrot genome assembly provides new insights into carotenoid accumulation and asterid genome evolution - Nature Genetics (2016) doi:10.1038/ng.3565 Received 23 September 2015 Accepted 11 April 2016 Published online 09 May 2016&nbsp;&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3565.html">link here</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Carrot Museum page on the <a href="today.html">genome discovery here</a>.</i></p>

<p>Carrots are one of the ten most economically important vegetable crops in the world. <i>( Simon, Philipp W.; Freeman, Roger E.; Vieira, Jairo V.; et al. (2008). "Carrot". Vegetables II. Handbook of Plant Breeding. 2. New York, NY: Springer. pp. 327�357. ISBN 978-0-387-74108-6.)</i></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Carrot is an economically important horticultural crop that has gained popularity since world War Two (ended 1945) due to increased awareness of its nutritional value. Orange carrots are highly revered as �good for the eyes� due to their high content of hydrocarbon carotenoids, a class of phytochemicals that are often precursors to vitamin A. α- and β-Carotene predominate in orange carrots.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Types of Carrots</b></font> - there are two distinct categories of carrot in the modern world, the Cultivated Carrot (domesticated), which is detailed below, and the Wild Carrot which now has its own page. <a href="queen.html">Click here to go there</a>.</font>.</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="botanical"></a>For information here is the <b>full botanical classification</b> of a carrot:</p>
<p>Kingdom Plantae � Plants; Subkingdom Tracheobionta � Vascular plants Superdivision Spermatophyta � Seed plants; Division Magnoliophyta � Flowering plants Class Magnoliopsida � Dicotyledons; Subclass Rosidae Order Apiales; Family Apiaceae � Carrot family Genus Daucus L. � wild carrot P; Species Daucus carota L. ssp. sativus- domestic carrot</p>
<p>(It is generally accepted that domesticated carrot is drawn from the wild variety)</p>
<p>Note - Some classifications show Umbelliferae rather than Apiaceae.</p>
<hr />
<p>The cultivated carrot is the second most popular vegetable in the world after the potato. When you read the <a href="nutrition.html" title="The Carrot has some amazing healthy properties. It can be a vital aid to health and fitness">nutrition pages</a> you will see and agree why it should be number one. The health benefits of carrots are well established and cover a wide range in human health conditions. In general, carrots are important for healthy eyes, skin, hair, growth, and immune systems. They can lower cholesterol, prevent heart attacks, and help reduce the risk of certain types of cancers. Carrots are packed with nutrients<font face="Arial">In fact in England the carrot is Number One according to a survey carried out by the National Trust in 2002. Overall, 17% of the 2,</font><img border="0" src="photos/multia.jpg" alt="carrots of many colors" align="right" width="251" height="278" hspace="5" vspace="6" /><font face="Arial">031 people in the survey opted for the carrot. It came ahead of the potato (15%) and broccoli (13%) in a battle of the vegetable patch. Least favourites by those questioned were Brussels Sprouts, Parsnip, Swede and Turnip. Although, there are many different carrot varieties available, British farmers tend to grow the Nairobi variety, a berlicum-nantes cross, which is reliable, damage resistant and produces a good yield.</font></p>
<p>The carrot plant is cultivated across the world for its prized taproot. The plant is biennial and bears flowers during the second year of its life. However, in general, the whole plant is harvested prematurely when the root reaches about an inch in diameter, tender and juicy. Carrots vary widely in colour and shape depending on the cultivar types. The colours are shown in the photo below and shapes and typologies lower down, with more detail on a separate page in the museum <a href="rootshapes.html">here.</a></p>
<p>Daucus is a worldwide genus of herbaceous plants of the family Apiaceae of which the best-known species is the cultivated carrot. The Daucus genus of Umbelliferae Apiaceae, has about 25 species.</p>
<p>Approximately 175 carrot cultivars of carrot were commercially available in 2013, in the USA.</p>
<p>The cultivated carrot, hybridised from the wild carrot, can be either an annual (mainly in tropical areas) or a biennial (mainly in temperate areas). It is an erect herb of 20-50 cm tall when mature, and 120-150 cm when flowering. The taproot is fleshy, straight, conical to cylindrical, 5-50 cm long and 2-5 cm in diameter at the top, and usually orange (other colours include: purple, yellow, or white). Daucus Carota is a complex species, botanically comprising both wild and cultivated carrots.</p>
<p>All information within these pages refers to Daucus carota sativus, some of the varieties of which are described below. Other members of the carrot family include: Chervil, Celery. Celeriac, Arracacha, Fennel, Parsnip and Parsley.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Carrot Genome Web Sequenced - May 2016</b></font> - An international team has sequenced and begun an analysis of the genome of the carrot, Daucus carota.</p>
<p>The new, high-quality genome assembly, which the researchers established for an orange doubled-haploid carrot, contains more than 32,000 predicted protein-coding genes. As the researchers reported today in Nature Genetics, they were able to track down a candidate gene involved in orange carrot pigmentation and gained insight into the evolution of plants in the euasterid II lineage, which contains carrots, lettuce, sunflower, celery, and parsley.</p>

<p><b><a name="main types"></a>There are two main types of cultivated carrots:</b></p>
<p>1. <b><font color="#FF0000">Eastern/Asiatic carrots</font></b> - These are often called anthocyanin carrots because of their purple roots, although some have yellow roots. They have pubescent leaves giving them a grey-green colour and bolt easily. They have slightly dissected leaves, with branched roots and are an annual plant. The greatest diversity of these carrots is found in Afghanistan, Russia, Iran and India. These are the possible centres of domestication which took place around the 10th century. These types of carrot are still under cultivation in Asia, but are being rapidly replaced by orange rooted Western varieties.<br />
(Purple carrots are making a comeback <a href="maroon.html">click here for details</a>).</p>
<p><font face="Arial">2. <b><font color="#FF0000">Western or Carotene Carrots</font></b> - These have orange, red or white roots. It is most likely these carrots derived from the first group by selection among hybrid progenies of yellow Eastern carrots, white carrots and wild subspecies grown in the Mediterranean. the first two originated by mutation. These have strongly dissected leaves, the roots are un-branched and they have a bright green, sparsely hairy foliage and are biennial. These carrots may have originated in Turkey.<br />
<br />
The western carrot is the by far the most popular carrot and can in turn be sub-divided into three groups:<br />
<br />
1. Short-rooted varieties: These types mature more quickly and the first to be sown.<br />
e.g.: Amsterdam Forcing, Tiana, Early French Frame, Early Nantes, Champion Scarlet Horn.<br />
2. Medium-rooted varieties: The most common type of commercially grown carrots.<br />
e.g.: Mokum; Flakkee; Autumn King; Chantenay Red Cored; Royal Chantenay.<br />
3. Long-rooted varieties: These are usually grown in well-prepared and deep soils: e.g.: New Red Intermediate, Saint Valery.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Tio (This is organics) Ltd is one of the leading organic food producers and suppliers in the UK and one of the largest growers of organic carrots in the UK and Europe. Organic carrots are their core product which are supplied year round. For approximately 10 months of the year carrots are grown in Scotland.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">A farming method pioneered by this company is affectionately known as the NUTS (Non-Umbelliferous Targeting Sabre) machine (shown right). Every season an 80 strong workforce helps to hand weed our organic carrot fields. Literally lying down on the job and facing the field, the tractors pull these specially designed trailers slowly along the field beds, giving the workers adequate time to pick all the weeds.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Check out this video of a harvester in action. The Dewulf GKIIISE falls into the category of "really big, extremely specialized machines" and can pluck three whole rows of carrots out of the ground without harming them. <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/99pOKIwhMjw">Here</a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Grimmways</font></b> - the largest carrot producer in the USA <i>(visited in February 2015 - <a href="grimmways.html">photos here</a>)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><img border="0" src="photos/gways%20(7).jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="145" height="140" />Grimmway Farms is dedicated to providing good value, consistent quality and dependable service to fulfill customers� needs - those guiding principles have enabled our company to conduct business with integrity for more than 40 years.. The story of Grimmway began in 1968, when brothers Rod and Bob Grimm set up a roadside produce stand and planted the seed that would blossom into today�s Grimmway Farms. Ten years later, the brothers moved north to Kern County, where the family business took root and prospered from their dedication to product quality and customer service. For more than 45 years, our commitment to that promise continues to be upheld as a top priority.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Grimmway Farms� dedication to consistent quality and dependable service has made them the global leader in our industry. Grimmway Farms has grown to become not only one of the largest growers, producers and shippers of carrots in the world but also a leading supplier of organic produce, potatoes and carrot juice concentrate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Beginning with our founders� farm stand in 1968,&nbsp; At Grimmway Farms, their commitment to customers is to continue to offer unsurpassed quality, innovative products and packaging; and to employ strict safety standards and extensive sustainability programs and practices. - See more at: <a href="http://www.grimmway.com/carrots/about-grimmway/#sthash.Jv2Dby28.dpuf">http://www.grimmway.com/carrots/about-grimmway/#sthash.Jv2Dby28.dpuf</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">In 1985 Grimmways moved the carrot processing plant to Bakersfield, CA wherethe climate enables two annual carrot crops.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Grimmways grow carrots in a variety of regions in California to ensure ideal growing conditions year round. Carrots thrive in the sandy, loamy soils of California. These soils, combined with the ideal California climate (75� to 85�days and cool nights 50� to 60�), provide the optimal growing conditions. As a result, they transition growing areas throughout Central and Southern California to ensure just-picked carrots are delivered to their customers for every season. - See more at: http://www.grimmway.com/carrots/our-process/where-we-grow/#sthash.KkFgthOL.dpuf</p>
