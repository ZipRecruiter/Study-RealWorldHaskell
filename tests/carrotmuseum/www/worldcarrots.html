<p><font face="Arial">China is Carrot production King of the World , the US ranks among the other top nations in the production of carrots: fourth in acreage and volume, third in terms of yield (31.7 tons/ha). Russia, Japan, France and the United Kingdom are also leading producers. World wide 13.37 million tons were produced in 1990, a 30% increase over the past decade.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Carrot consumption in the US increased sharply in the 1990s, from about 10 pounds a person per year to 14 pounds. Kern county, California dominates US carrot production, and two firms control 90 percent of California fresh carrots--most growers produce carrots under contract for these firms. Texas, Wisconsin, and Minnesota are also large producers. Quite a few also emanate from Holtville, California which dubs itself <font color="#FF0000">"The Carrot Capital of the World."</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; Learn about the <a href="festivals.html">Annual Carrot Festival</a> (and others) by clicking here.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Carrots are ninth (out of twenty eight) among vegetable crops in the US. Average value of commercial crop is about $70,500,000 per year based on fresh-market and processed carrots, accounting for about 875,000 tons of carrots. <i>(1979 figures)</i><br />

<p><font face="Arial"><b>UK</b> - <a target="_blank" href="http://britishcarrots.co.uk/">British Carrot Growers Association</a> - UK grows approx 700,000 tons of carrots per year and is self sufficient for 11 months of the year. The main variety grown are Nantes variants, often Bolero, Laguna and Nairobi.<b>In Europe</b> the UK has the highest production with 750,000 tons per year. Next come France (568k), Netherlands (476k) and Italy (407k) others large producers include Poland and Germany.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><a target="_blank" href="http://britishorganiccarrots.co.uk/">British Organic Carrots</a> - Here, you�ll find a whole bunch of stuff on one of the healthiest, most delicious and ethically produced vegetables you can buy. This includes amazingly inventive ways to eat organic carrots, astounding facts about their health benefits, and an introduction to some of the British farmers growing them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><b>Poland</b> has an important place in European production of vegetables. In production of cabbage and carrot they have first place in Europe and as much as 20% of the total vegetable production of Europe consists of cabbage and about 18% of carrots produced in Poland. Comparing to the total world production of vegetables the share of polish cabbage amounts about 5% and that of carrots slightly above 5%. <a href="polandprod.pdf">Read more here.</a></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">GpoiW Polfarm is one of the leading growers in Poland. The company grow carrots in the northern region of Poland and since they are close to the sea, there is a lot more humidity and the heat is not as extreme as in the centre of Poland and this results in better quality carrots.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">About 20 per cent of the carrot harvest is destined for export, growing carrots on about 400 hectares, 80 per cent is sold in the domestic market, but 20 per cent is exported. This comes down to about 7000 tons a season. The main export markets are Slovakia, Lithuania, Romania and Germany. However they have also sent smaller shipments to Spain, Scotland and Scandinavia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Polfarm is also making sure they can keep up with food safety regulations in the rest of Europe. They grow vegetables without any residues and have a gold-level in the ASAP certification. Supermarkets are getting more demanding about removing residues from the equation while growing any produce, so we have to innovate.�</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">They innovate by using OZON-technology, which uses O3. After the washing and peeling is done, spraying the produce with the O3, to get rid of any bacteria or pests. The great thing about this is that it's 100 percent natural.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Germany</b> - The most important root vegetable undoubtedly is the carrot, which in 2017 was produced on 12,545 hectares in Germany, according to the Federal Information Center for Agriculture (BZL). As a result, the acreage increased by 1,336 hectares compared to year before. Most carrots are grown on fields in North Rhine-Westphalia, followed by those of Lower Saxony, Rhineland-Palatinate, Bavaria, Schleswig-Holstein and Baden-W�rttemberg, which together account for almost 85 percent of the acreage. 527,000 metric tons of carrots were harvested in Germany in 2015.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Although orange carrots account for the largest market share, new attractive varieties with white, yellow, red or purple colours, as well as bicoloured varieties, have been added in recent years. At the same time, forgotten root vegetables such as parsnips are finding their way to the German markets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Located in Hochdorf-Assenheim, which lies in the heart of the Palatine Region,&nbsp; the Augustin company has developed over the past 50 years into a sophisticated business with a dedicated logistics infrastructure, to become a major player in the German carrot industry. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.augustin-gemuesehandel.de/en/">website here</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><a name="netherlands"></a>The Netherlands</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Holland, the ancestral home of orange carrots. Over half of the land mass is dedicated to agriculture and horticulture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The popular theory that Dutch farmers bred orange carrots as a tribute to William of Orange has largely been debunked by recent genetic research. This casts doubt on the royal carrot conspiracy by showing orange carrots have been around for much longer than the 16th century. The researchers for the first time completely mapped the genome of the carrot, and found that mutations caused orange carrots to first appear in the days of the Roman Empire. The study found that carrots were indeed bred for their orange colour by Dutch farmers, but ecologist Klaas Vriedling states �there is good evidence that the orange carrots had been there before.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The country is the 12 largest producer of carrots in the world.(2007 statistics) One significant producer is Van der Linde BV in the Dutch town of Emmeloord Van which specializes in the trade, storage and processing of potatoes and carrots. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanderlindebv.com">Website here.</a>&nbsp; The main varieties grown are Nerac and Narbonne. These varieties are also grown in the "polders" (clay soil).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Van der Linde BV is a family business that has been active in the potato trade since 1959 and started trading in carrots in the early nineties. It exports products all over the world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The company kindly forwarded some sample bags for display by the Carrot Museum. Images of 10kg and 5kg bags below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Australia</b> Carrots are also grown on a large scale in Australia. &nbsp;In 1999, 267,000 tonnes of carrots were produced from about 7,500 hectares. There is also an Australian Carrot, which is native. <font color="#FF0000">First records in Australia</font> show it arrived in 1788 with the First Fleet and convicts planted 'Long Orange' carrots on Norfolk Island just two weeks after their arrival and gathered in their first harvest in October of that year. Along with the cabbage, it became an important food for the colonists. <a href="australia.html">Australia page here</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>France</b> - In France, both the carrot and the parsnip were equally appreciated until the end of the 19th century. In 1853, Husson recorded the amounts of the major vegetables consumed in Paris per year. For carrots, 8,059, 200 bunches were devoured. At 2 1/2 kilos (about 5 pounds) per bunch (bunches were big then!), that amounted to more than 50,000,000 pounds. Parsnips, while less sought-after, were still consumed at a respectable 495,400 bunches or approximately 2,500,000 pounds per year.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">But by the end of the 19th century, the French became so enamoured of the potato that it largely replaced the parsnip in culinary usage. Now, parsnips are found only in the best markets and especially in organic markets where producers offer an especially wide variety of produce.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Today the best-known carrot in France is the carotte de Cr�ances<img border="0" src="photos/sandcarrot.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="sand carrots of Creances, France" width="640" height="100" />, grown in the sandy soil of lower Normandie, near the town of Cotentin. Only eight villages are allowed to call their carrots by this special name. The carotte de Cr�ances has a regulated growing regimen which includes a special fertilizer of local seaweeds rich in sulfur and iodine as well as manure. However, in Parisian markets the premium carrot is simply called "the sand carrot," (carotte de sable). Grown by 18 different villages not far from the carrot of Creances' territory, the sand carrot is said to be coreless and is always sold carefully unwashed, so that you are assured of its origin by its sugar-doughnut-like appearance. The favoured variety for sand carrots is the 'Rouge de Carentan', a coreless variety.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The carrots are stored in the ground, often protected by a layer of straw, and only lifted when needed for market. They are always sold unwashed which helps preserve flavour.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">There is an annual festival (F�te de la Carotte) held in Cr�ances on the second Saturday in August. La Confr�rie Des Mou�geous d'Carottes de Cr�ances (The Brotherhood of Cr�ances Carrot Eaters) parade through the town in their ceremonial robes with the best of that year�s crop. Then there is much speech making and the awarding of carrot related gongs. Given the first festival wasn�t until 1990 it all seems about as authentic as a ploughman�s lunch, the carrots however are most certainly the real thing. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/festivals.html#creances">(more here in the Museum's Festivals page)</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Carrot and parsnip in speech and tradition. (Warning: In order to avoid falling asleep, you might want to skip this part if you're not a language freak.) I am unaware of any figures of speech in English turning on the carrot and parsnip (except for "carrot-top" meaning red-haired). Perhaps an alert reader can fill me in on some I've overlooked. But in France, both the carrot and the parsnip, due to their cylindrical form, have been used of course to allude to the male sex. (Yes, French is undoubtedly the language richest in figures of speech having to do with sex. Not surprising, is it?)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The carrot figures abundantly, however, in other French expressions. It even evolved into a verb--carotter--which means to get something from someone by means of a ruse or other fraudulent means. An "eater of carrots" (mangeur des carottes) is a fool, a naive person easy to be had. "Jouer la carotte" means to play with small stakes. And, a carotteur or carotteuse is someone who swindles you out of money by means of his or her sexual favours.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">French gardening traditions were full of superstitious tricks for ensuring a good harvest. These varied from an incantation to having to wear a new shirt when planting carrots, to touching your thigh while planting them, muttering "long as my thigh, thick as my thigh" to ensure your carrots would thus grow. The French have always believed--and still do!--that carrots, along with other roots, must be planted during the waning moon to prevent bolting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>New Zealand</b> - In 1773, British explorer James Cook and navigator Tobias Furneaux planted a number of gardens in Queen Charlotte Sound, with plants such as potatoes, carrots, parsnips, cabbages, onions, leeks, parsley, radish, mustard, broad beans, kidney beans, peas, turnips and wheat. That same year, south of Cape Kidnappers, Cook gave the Māori chief Tuanui roots and seeds, including wheat, beans, peas, cabbages, turnips, onions, carrots, parsnips and yams.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Settler gardens were characterised by their large size and great variety of produce. The productive gardens at the Kerikeri mission station in the 1820s were about one-third of a hectare and grew:<img border="0" src="photos/white1.jpg" align="right" width="231" height="310" vspace="3" alt="White Carrots" /></font></p>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial">vegetables � asparagus, beans, beetroot, broccoli, cabbages, carrots, celery, cress, cucumbers, endive, lettuces, onions, peas, potatoes, pumpkins, radishes, shallots and turnips</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial">When Europeans arrived, Māori replaced their traditional crops with those brought by Europeans. Their main crop was soon potatoes, which provided a heavier and more reliable food source than kūmara, and could be grown throughout the country. Corn, cabbages, tobacco, carrots, turnips, squash, swedes and new varieties of kūmara were also added to Māori gardens.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">By the start of the 19th century vegetable growing had become a highly profitable enterprise for some coastal tribes who sold or traded their vegetables with whalers, sealers and the first European settlers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Although Māori adopted the new crops they did not adopt all European horticultural practices. Māori were reluctant to use hoes and spades, preferring their traditional tools. They also refrained from fertilising their crops with animal manure, instead continuing to clear new sites when the fertility of their gardens dropped.

<p class="MsoNormal">No universally-cultivated vegetable enjoyed less regard as an ingredient of cuisine in 19th-century America than the carrot. The authors of US cookbooks repeatedly observed that, �carrots are not a very favourite vegetable for the table. They are used in broths and soups, but chiefly sent to table as a garnish, or an accompaniment to salt fish.� Even the carrot�s defenders were compelled to notice that �[t]his vegetable is but little used, except in soups; yet they are very palatable and healthy, containing a great amount of nutriment.� The distaste was for carrots themselves, not their mode of preparation, for the commonest way of cooking them�what some cookbooks designated �American style Carrots��was to boil them soft and serve them with butter, as simple a rendering as might be conceived, aside from chewing them raw. No cookbook of prior 1900 recommended consuming uncooked carrots.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Why, then, did most US gardens contain carrots? Because since time immemorial they stood foremost among the vegetables that livestock savoured. Both tops and roots appealed. In New England, in early November, the farmer �cut off the tops, near, but not quite to the crown of the plant, with sharp hoes; they are greedily eaten by oxen, cows, sheep, and swine�then run a plough deep� to unearth the roots for use through the winter. Many argued that they were the most nutritious field crop for animals. �One bushel of carrots will yield more nourishment than two bushels of oats, or potatoes, and it is a remarkable fact, that horses will frequently leave oats to feed on carrots.� Because of the cost of growing grains, claims such as these found a wide welcome in the second quarter of the century. Experimentalists noted that it thrived when intercropped with flax seed, so that a field could yield two products simultaneously; furthermore, the vegetable did not leech the soil of nutriments as most grains did.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When planting carrots, care had to be taken that the soil was deeply ploughed and free of stones. The small feathery seeds were planted by a dibble or drill eighteen inches apart on a still day, so wind did not blow the seed astray. Once seed had been deposited in the drill hole, the field hand used his foot to push soil into the hole and step on it to seal it. Because the carrot did not have natural predators that attacked it during the early stages of growth (such as the turnip fly for turnips), it enjoyed a relatively carefree cycle of growth. In the antebellum period cattle farmers frequently intercropped carrots with mangel wurtzel, a root vegetable rather like a coarse rutabaga, that also enjoyed great favor as animal feed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the colonial period and early republic the long orange carrot, England�s standard root, grew universally in American fields. The French white and purple carrots were specimen plants cultivated by experimental gardeners exclusively. In the 1850s the White Belgian and Scarlet varieties enjoyed a vogue among hotel cooks. After the Civil War, the Danvers, the Altringham, and the Early French Forcing Carrot came into wide cultivation.</p>

<blockquote><b>Shakers - 1843</b>
<p class="MsoNormal">Directions for preserving vegetables in the winter were printed in the 1843 edition of The Gardener's Manual, published by the United Society (Shakers). The method is similar to others of the nineteenth century, although the "circular" form described was unique to the Shakers:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Beets and carrots should be gathered before hard frost in the Fall, the tops cut off and the roots packed away in sand in a warm cellar. A good method of preserving Beets and Carrots fresh through the Winter is, to lay them in a circular form on the bottom of the cellar, with the roots in the centre and heads outward; cover the first course of roots with sand; then lay another course upon them, and cover with sand as before, and so on until all are packed and covered. The sand for Carrots should be very dry or they will rot; for Beets it may be moist, but not wet. Celery is preserved in the same way. Onions and Turnips keep well on scaffolds, or in barrels, in a dry cool cellar. (The Gardener's Manual, 1843)</i></p>

<p><b>Africa</b> - Carrot is a popular vegetable with high vitamin A content, grown in East Africa mostly in the cooler highlands. The roots are consumed raw or cooked, alone or in combination with other vegetables (for example, peas), as an ingredient of soups, sauces and in dietary compositions. Young leaves are sometimes eaten raw or used as fodder. Carrots are an important source of vitamin A in African diets.</p>
