<p><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">A. Health Properties</font> </b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Carrot seed oil is steam distilled from the dried fruit (seeds). Carrot root oil is obtained by solvent extraction of the red carrot (root) and contains high levels of carotenes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Carrot seed oil is a yellow or amber-coloured to pale orange-brown liquid of peculiar dry-woody, somewhat root-like, earthy odour. The initial notes are sweet and fresh, but<img src="gifs/scarrots.gif" width="55" height="57" align="right" />the tenacious undertone and dry out is very heavy, earthy, fatty-oily, slightly spicy. Normally the seed is first crushed, and then distilled with direct steam, care being taken that the steam does not form channels through the seed material in the still, which would result in a subnormal yield of oil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Oil content can be very variable, 0.05 however, like celery seed, carrot seed can be distilled without crushing, and this will minimize the carry-over of odourless fixed oil in the distillate. Although there are no accurate medicinal data on this oil, many of the following actions are attributed to infusions or alcoholic solutions of the whole seed: anthelmintic, antiseptic, carminative, depurative, diuretic, hepatic, cytophylactic and stimulant. There are even suggestions that it might be anti-diabetic, anti-hypercholesterol and a liver regenerator.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img src="gifs/carpic2.gif" width="45" height="104" align="left" />Respected aromatherapy references suggest that it is useful for the treatment of dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, wrinkles, and that it aids dry skin and revitalises the basal layer. There is also evidence that it assists circulation and aids muscular tension. It has been suggested that it might be useful for the treatment of hypertension and neurasthenia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It is hormonal in action and helps the pituitary gland to regulate the production of thyroxine and the release of ova. It is also said to ease PMT. Carrot seed oil is said to have a powerful tonic action on the liver and gall-bladder, and is used in the treatment of jaundice and other liver disorders.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">B. Skin Protection</font> </b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">How can the brazen quest for a beautiful tan and the need for protection from UVR be reconciled? You won't find the answer in any newly engineered chemicals. Nature holds the solution in Carrot Oil. Suncare products containing naturally extracted Carrot Oil quickly produce a beautiful golden tan and better protect the skin against the damaging effects of UVR than chemical sunscreens alone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Carrot Oil is a golden coloured extract from carrots with extraordinary skin protection and conditioning benefits derived from the high quantities of oil soluble carotenoids that it contains. Carotenoids are a class of easily assimilated antioxidants, which are present in a wide range of fruits and vegetables but most abundant in carrots. Antioxidants protect human cells from harmful free-radical attack. Free-radicals are stray oxygen molecules that attack healthy cell walls and react with polyunsaturated fats to create a chain reaction of unlimited free-radical regeneration. Free-radicals are produced by a wide range of environmental pollutants, including UVR. If left unchecked by antioxidants, free-radicals damage both the structure and function of cell membranes, resulting in premature aging, cancer and an array of degenerative diseases.</font></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="antiox.html"><font face="Arial">Read more about antioxidants here.</font></a></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Carotenoids, when either topically applied or ingested, directly reduce the damaging effects of UVR. Specifically, carotenoids have been found to enhance the body's immune response to UVR, decreasing skin damage from ultraviolet exposure. Carotenoids have even been proven to inhibit the proliferation of various types of cancer cells. Carrots contain over 600 identified carotenoids, making them an unparalleled source of antioxidants. Carrot Oil, derived from pure carrot extract, is the most potent source of the highest concentration of carotenoids available. Suncare products with only Beta-carotene (a single carotenoid), although possibly beneficial, do not contain the wide range of antioxidants contained in Carrot Oil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In addition to carotenoids, Carrot Oil contains other powerful antioxidants such as tocopheryl, or vitamin E. Studies have shown that topical application of vitamin E may directly reduce many harmful effects of UVR, enhance skin immunity and help heal a sunburn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Carrot Oil also acts as a natural tanning enhancer, producing a visibly golden tan in a short amount of time. The natural colour of Carrot Oil is deep gold and will appear so in solutions containing effective concentrations (between 2% to 10%). Either alone or when combined with other tanning enhancers, such as tyrosine or riboflavin, suncare products containing effective concentrations of Carrot Oil provide a noticeably golden, even tan without any unwanted orange colouration.<br />
It must be noted that the beneficial effects of Carrot Oil may be diminished if placed in a mineral oil base. Mineral oil, commonly known as baby oil, is a petroleum derivative that decreases the absorption of and depletes the body's reserves of vitamins, especially vitamin E.8 During exposure to UVR, this is of special concern. Of even greater concern, the World Health Organization and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have published findings that mineral oil has been determined to cause cancer in humans. Unfortunately for the consumer, most suncare products are almost wholly comprised of mineral oil because it serves as an inexpensive base. However, there are Carrot Oil suncare products available that do not contain mineral oil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In summary, Carrot Oil used in combination with topical sunscreens provides more optimal protection against skin cancer and photo aging than chemical sunscreens alone. In order to maximize the positive effects, look for Carrot Oil products that expressly do not contain mineral oil and that have a deep golden colour upon application to the skin.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="photos/facemask.jpg" width="496" height="248" /></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If you have rough skin and want it to be moist and have that glow, how about trying a carrot face pack? This may be the best facial mask for you - Carrot Facial Masks<img border="0" src="photos/carrotoil1.jpg" align="right" width="146" height="158" /></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">A carrot facial pack is very effective for facial skin restoration and aids you feel fresh, firm and revives the skin immediately after use. This is due to the carotene contained in carrots. Carotene is a component that contributes to the colour of the carrot and once it is absorbed into our body, it turns into Vitamin A. It also functions to prevent further skin problems by forming a skin protective films to maintain balance for our skin.</font></p>
<p>Three Homemade Carrot Face Mask Recipes:</p>
<p>1.Peel &amp; steam carrots. Peel one large carrot and steam or boil until tender (when a fork can easily pierce through it, it's ready). Mash the carrot with a fork or masher until it's a creamy consistency.</p>
<p>2.Mix in honey and extra virgin olive oil. Mix in half a tablespoon of honey and half a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. If your skin is oily, you may omit the extra virgin olive oil.</p>
<p>3.Add a few drops of lemon juice. Your skin type will depend on the amount of lemon juice you add in (lemon juice is a natural astringent, so the oilier your skin, the more lemon you want in your mask). If you have dry skin, add about 8 drops of lemon and if you have oily skin, add up to 1 tablespoon.</p>
<p>4.Check consistency. The mixture shouldn't be too clumpy or too runny. If the mix is too thick, you can add in a bit more extra virgin olive oil or water to thin it out. You can add a bit more honey to the mix to give it a thicker, paste-like texture.</p>
<p>5.Cool down. Let the mixture cool down so that the temperature is comfortable on your skin.</p>
<p>6.Mask time. Apply the carrot mask onto a clean and bare face, even your neck if you wish, but avoid the eye and mouth area. Leave it on for 10 -15 minutes and wash it off with warm water afterwards. Pat dry and follow up with your favorite moisturizer or eye cream.</p>
<p>Tip: Like any skincare product, be sure to patch test the mask on yourself to ensure that negative reactions do not occur. If you ever feel any discomfort or irritation after you've applied the mask, wash it off immediately with warm water.</p>
