<p>Sunshine Glynn, another recent addition to the collectors list - here is her carrot story - <img border="0" src="photos/sunshine5.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="156" /></p>
<p>"In college, my future husband (Jaime) and I worked on the residence life staff together.&nbsp; We were best friends and although romantically interested in one another it took us almost a year to make it official.&nbsp; We were a silly couple, playing pranks and making memories."<br />
<br />
"One day, Jaime was headed to the store and asked me if I wanted anything.&nbsp; I responded with "bring me something that will make me happy".&nbsp; Now, in my mind, that "something" either tasted like chocolate or was in full bloom.&nbsp; Instead of candy or flowers, Jaime came back with the largest bag of carrots I had ever seen.&nbsp; I looked at him with a "you've got to be kidding" look.&nbsp; "What", he exclaimed.&nbsp; "Carrots make you happy.&nbsp; Have you ever seen anyone eat a carrot who wasn't smiling?".&nbsp; Not that I had ever noticed, but maybe he was right.&nbsp; We spent the rest of the year using "Carrots make you happy" as a catch phrase.&nbsp; It was only a matter of time before they started accumulating them."</p>
<p>Sunshine started collecting in about 1997.<br />
<br />
On their&nbsp; wedding day, their flower girl handed out carrots shaped bags filled with candy to the guests!<br />

Sunshine is a self proclaimed carrot purest and does not collect anything that has a bunny attached to it.&nbsp;She also tries to avoid items with other vegetables on them!&nbsp; Over time, the carrot collection has taken shape in her kitchen.&nbsp; Specifically she loves carrot plates, salt and pepper shakers, serving dishes, kitchen towels and&nbsp; pitchers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like many other collectors (catchphrase, less cutesy more carrot!) she has have weeded out the riffraff and now only acquire the<br />
things her soul can't live without!&nbsp; She has started collecting carrot fabric to make a carrot quilt, and never passes up children's clothes if they have carrots on them!<br />
<br />
Sunshine says - " I do have a couple of favourite items.&nbsp; I love my carrot "rat".&nbsp; My husband found it on a trip and brought it home as a gift.&nbsp; The rat keeps me company when I cook."<br />
<br />
"I am fascinated that there are other people out there like me.&nbsp; Who would have thought there would be more than one person who collects carrots!&nbsp; We are a weird bunch!" - you got it in one!&nbsp; Carrot Museum says - Not weird so much as unique, eccentric and special! after all it is a wonderful vegetable and inspires many.</p>
<p>Here are some samples from Sunshine's collection.</p>
