<br />
All you need is 4 ounces of carrot juice, 10 ounces Palm Oil, 4 ounces Coconut Oil, 2 ounces Olive Oil, 2 ounces lye, 4 ounces water. (Lye is water alkanised for use in washing ï¿½ available at chemists)<br />
<br />
Mix the lye and water and set aside to cool. Melt the oils together, set aside to cool. Once cooled gently pour lye into oils. Add juice to mixture, stirring constantly. Mix until soap traces, pour into prepared moulds, allow to stand covered for 48 hours. Remove from moulds, cut as needed, and allow to age open to the air for 3 weeks.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">Late Carrot Friend Ann &nbsp;Beck from Arizona</font> has produced some super variations of the standard recipe, making delightful Castile Soap and Twenty Two Carrot Soap.&nbsp; Sadly Ann passed away in March 2011 and the recipes here live on as a tribute to her memory.</p>
<p>Carrot Soap is easy to make. The Beta Carotene in carrots makes it very good for your skin, the lather is lovely and creamy, and the orange colour of the soap itself is beautiful.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Carrot Castile Soap</font> <img src="photos/annsoap1a.jpg" width="281" height="231" alt="Ann Beck's Castile Carrot Soap" align="right" /></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Recipe:</font><br />
<br />
1 cup carrot juice;<br />
5 tablespoons lye;<br />
2 cups olive oil 1/2 cup canola oil;<br />
(optional) tiny dried dice of carrot. Cut it as small as possible. When dry it should be like sand grains. &nbsp;<i>notes:<br />
<br />
It's very important to use rubber gloves and eye protection when using lye. One can hand mix the soap, but it's far simpler to use a food processor. The word "trace" means if you drip some soap from a spoon onto the surface of the batch, it leaves a faint mark. Tracing is less critical if the soap is made in the processor. With processor soap, the batch should be the consistency of whipping cream.<br />
<br />
Hand mixed soap can separate and take up to two hours or even more of stirring to achieve trace. Soap must be poured as soon as it has traced. it sets up very quickly.<br />
<br />
Never use aluminium utensils or moulds. Lye reacts badly with it. stainless steel is fine, as is plastic. Take care not to allow lye grains to touch Formica countertops&nbsp;(worktops). It will discolour it. It's best to measure the lye with the container in the sink.</i><br />
<br />
<font color="#0000FF">Method:</font><br />
<br />
1.measure the carrot juice and place it into a Pyrex cup, of at least two cups capacity. Place the cup into a sink.<br />
<br />
2. mix the two oils together and barely heat them to 110 degrees F.<br />
<br />
3. Carefully measure the lye and set aside in a glass.<br />
<br />
4. Pour the lye into the carrot juice and stir with a wooden utensil, like a chopstick or a bamboo skewer, until the lye dissolves. THE liquid/lye combination will have a chemical reaction and will heat up to about 180 degrees F. EVENTUALLY the juice/lye combination needs to cool to 110 degrees F, which is just barely discernible to your wrist. YOU can use a thermometer, of course.<br />
<br />
5. when the oil and the lye mixture are both at about 110, pour the oils into the food processor and add the lye mixture. Process until trace has occurred.<br />
<br />
6. have your moulds arranged on a newspaper covered cookie sheet. Pour the soap into the molds. Cover the molds with lids or with plastic wrap, taking care not to have the lids or wrap touch the soap.<br />
<br />
7. Put the soap batch in a draftless spot and cover it with a towel to protect the heat that will occur as the saponification process (the chemical change that creates soap) proceeds. Allow the batch to remain covered until it has cooled, usually overnight.<br />
<br />
<i>(At this point, you'll do your clean up. always protect your eyes and hands during this phase. it's best to wash everything in the sink and again in the dishwasher. raw soap would take the hide off of a rhinoceros.)</i><br />
<br />
8. Uncover the soap, remove the plastic or the lids, and allow the soap to remain in the molds for (about) 2 days, or until it looks like it is pulling away from the sides of the molds.<br />
<br />
9. unmould the soap, lay it on pencils or chopsticks so that the air can circulate around it. It must cure for a month before use.</p>
