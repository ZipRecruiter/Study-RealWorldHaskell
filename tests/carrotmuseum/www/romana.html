<p align="left"><b>Newport newspaper Article here</b>:</p>
<p align="left">Romana Zawarti has a cacoethes for carrots. Claiming what anyone can tell is the world's largest collection of carrot paraphernalia, or �carrotobelia� to the trade, she has taken affinity for root vegetables to an entirely new level. She has carrot statues, carrot tableware, and even kids� carrot Crocs. The walls, ceiling, and yes floors, in what used to be a butler�s pantry, are covered in carrots large and small. What began just over 15 years ago as a simple purchase while Down East has put her atop the carrot collecting world. (Yes, there apparently is one). Describing herself as a purist � she collects carrots and only carrots � Ms. Zawarti�s collection is the gold-standard in carrotology. She doesn�t do bunnies, refuses to mix her veggies and has even served as an arbitrator for a pair of Greek towns gunning to be that country�s carrot capitol. More importantly, her light-hearted nature and ironic self awareness makes a visit to her carrot museum one Newport�s more unexpectedly charming treats. Currently, her collection of carrot paraphernalia tops more than 2,000 individual pieces. We caught up to her at her one of kind B&amp;B, the Armistead Cottage.</p>
<p start="" align="left">�I bought my first carrot piece in 1993. My husband and I went on a trip to Maine. There were lobsters everywhere � and blueberries. So I bought carrots.�</p>

<p align="left">What is it about collecting these little root vegetables that makes you do it?</p>
<p align="left">How many pieces of "carrot items" do you have? I�m up to 2,036. They�re all catalogued by number, date, location purchased or by who gave them to me. (And for the record: Duplicates only count once). How often do you look for new pieces? �I just began picking up one here and one there. By the time I knew it, my kitchen was full of carrots, so I began logging them. When we moved (from New York City), I had somewhere between 600 and 700 carrots. That was 10 years ago.�</p>
