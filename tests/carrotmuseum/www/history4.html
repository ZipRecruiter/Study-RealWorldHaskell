<hr /></center>
<p align="left">Britain's ingenuity in the wartime extended to the kitchen, and there's no better example of this than the humble carrot.</p>
<center>
<p align="left">The Second World War had a huge impact on how millions of British people cooked and ate. Food was �a munition of war�, a vital fuel to keep the population going.</p>
<center>
<p align="left">With imports hit hard by the attacks on shipping convoys, compromises were made to get Britain as far as possible towards self-sufficiency. Food was never wasted; alternate ingredients were constantly tried out. The Carrot was a classic example of this!</p>
</center>
</center>
<p align="left">The ubiquitous carrot was used widely a sweetener as well as a vegetable staple, and was promoted for its health benefits � leading to the �Doctor Carrot� character details of which are given later.</p>
<center>
<center>
<hr />
<center>
<p align="left">The Carrot is an economically important horticultural crop that has gained popularity since world War Two due to increased awareness of its nutritional value and versatility. Orange carrots are highly revered as �good for the eyes� due to their high content of hydrocarbon carotenoids, a class of phytochemicals that are often precursors to vitamin A. α- and β-Carotene predominate in orange carrots.</p>
</center>
</center>
</center>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The imposition of food rationing brought severe shortages and the UK Government looked for alternatives. Enter the carrot. The<a href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/ww2leaflet.html"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><img width="179" height="236" align="right" alt="War Time Cookery Leaflet - Carrots" src="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/ww2awmk.jpg" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5" /></span></a> government's Food Ministry produced lots of information on how carrots could be used as a viable substitute for non-available/restricted goods.&nbsp; In parallel the Agriculture Ministry encouraged increased commercial production of carrots, through various incentives. This was very successful leading to a surplus of carrots in early 1942. <span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Main Ministry of Food Carrot Leaflet <i>(right)</i> - click on image for separate page about the carrot publicity material used in WW2.</span></p>
<center>
<p align="left">During the 6 years of World War Two the UK Ministry of Food did its best to drum up enthusiasm for carrots as a substitute for rationed goods. Doctor Carrot, carrying a bag marked " Vit A", was prominently featured on pages of recipe books and extensive advertising campaigns in the press, cinema and on the radio.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">World war Two revived the popularity of the carrot and gave it a rightful place in the kitchen, elevated to a new high as a major food and nutritional source.</p>
</center>
<p>Carrots also feature during World War II as a secret code message was broadcast by the BBC French language service to tell the French resistance of the upcoming invasion of Normandy on D Day - (�les carottes sont cuites, je r�p�te, les carottes sont cuites� = �The carrots are cooked, I repeat, the carrots are cooked!�). The resistance fighters were preparing themselves to sabotage railway lines and telephone exchanges.</p>
<p>At 0915 on June 4<sup>th</sup> 1944 Radio London broadcast several messages, that to the casual listener seemed nonsensical.&nbsp; In fact the term is an old French turn of phrase.When making a stew, the carrots are said to be the last vegetables to be cooked. So when the carrots are already cooked, it�s game over, no more additional action can be done - no turning back. The next day 24000 soldiers of the allied forces waded into French Normandy and, in an epic battle, liberated it from the Nazi stronghold.</p>

<p align="left">Carrots were truly one of the foods that helped win the war. People experienced culinary delights s<img width="166" height="250" align="right" src="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/alottotellsm.jpg" border="0" alt="ww2 food facts advert" />uch as curried carrot, carrot jam, carrot puddings and a homemade drink called Carrolade. Most of these "delicacies" were nothing new and items such as cakes, puddings and jam had been enjoyed throughout Europe since the Middle Ages.</p>
<p align="left">Keeping a nation fed on wartime rations took remarkable ingenuity and a very strong stomach.</p>
<p align="left">Carrots also played a small part in winning the air battle. Famously, the UK Food Ministry responded to a temporary wartime oversupply of carrots by suggesting, through propaganda, that the RAF's exceptional night-flying and target success, was due to eating high carotene content carrots. The suggestion worked and the consumption of carrots increased sharply because people thought carrots might help them see better in the blackout, thus taking the pressure off other food supplies.</p>

<b>During the Second World War (1939-45)</b>&nbsp; <a name="uk"></a>Food, and in particular the lack of it, was central to the experience of the Second World War. Carrots were one vegetable which was in plentiful supply and as a result were widely-utilised as a substitute for scarce food<img width="125" height="183" align="right" alt="Front of Kitchen Front Recipe Book WW2" src="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/kitfront.jpg" border="0" hspace="4" vspace="4" />stuffs and used in several "mock" recipes. It was also a major ingredient of the Campaign called Dig for Victory, which was extensively publicised with songs and posters featuring Dr Carrot and Potato Pete. It was run for most of the war by Professor John Raeburn, a respected agricultural economist, who joined the Ministry of Food in 1939 as a statistician and two years later was appointed to lead the Agricultural Plans Branch. <i><a href="dig4victory.html">See the US Dig for Victory posters here.</a></i>
<p>Read what advice the US Government gave to its citizens in 1944 - <a href="uscarrotfactsheet1944.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Before the war, Britain imported 70% of its food; this required 20 million tons of shipping a year. 50% of meat was imported, 70% of cheese and sugar, 80% of fruits, 70% of cereals and fats, 91% of butter. Knowing this would lead the Axis powers into hoping to starve the British population into submission, by cutting off those food supply lines.</p>
<p>By 1941 the German blockade of food supply ships created food shortages had made things very difficult and the phrase "The Kitchen Front" came into use. It encouraged housewives to feel they were contributing to the war effort by cooking wisely and not wasting food. The British population emerged healthier than it had ever been before, and families had been educated in putting nutritional, frugal meals on their tables. In many ways, it was home economics that would win the war.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>Some contemporary quotes:
<p><font face="Arial"><b><i>"This is a food war. Every extra row of vegetables in allotments saves shipping the battle on the kitchen front cannot be won without help from the kitchen garden.</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i><b>Isn't an hour in the garden better than an hour in the queue?"</b> (Lord Woolton, Minister of Food, 1941)<b><br />
&nbsp;</b></i></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><i><font size="3"><b>"There used to be a joke about only donkeys eating carrots. Now it seems we shall all be donkeys if we don't."</b> Kitchen Front broadcast 7 January 1941</font></i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>"The Kitchen Front" -</b> During<img width="164" height="93" align="left" alt="Listen to the Kitchen Front advert WW2" src="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/listenkitchensm.jpg" border="0" vspace="6" hspace="6" /> the Second World War, millions of people listened to an early morning five-minute BBC radio programme. With the assistance of domestic science teachers, dieticians, school-meal-organisers and hospital caterers, the Public Relations Division of the Ministry of Food gave the public lasting guidance about new food sources and creative recipes for items which were not rationed. It also gave advice to people about the healthiest way to feed themselves and to make the best use of their rations.</p>
<p>"From the Kitchen Front" was broadcast on BBC Radio Home Service (now radio 4) every morning for 5 minutes, and a few of these radio broadcast scripts relating carrot items have been transcribed from the archives -<br /></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span lang="en-us"><a href="#broadcasts">Transcripts of radio broadcasts on carrots here</a> (pdfs)</span></font></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snauq-Yglhs">Gert and Daisy broadcast here</a> (Youtube).
<p>On 7 September 1940 the Kitchen Front offered this advice on cooking carrots:</p>
<blockquote><i><font size="3">�I have told you about the Aunt of mine who is the mother of all culinary secrets � well she listened to my talk to you on the value of simmering in which I mentioned carrots. She immediately said � you didn�t tell them that there is only one way of cooking carrots. Cut them up, the older they are the finer you cut them, and put them on to simmer in a pot with a little margarine or good dripping., a little sugar and salt <b>and no water at all</b>. Simmer them with the lid tight on for an hour and half. You should never really ever cook them any other way!�</font></i></blockquote>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="MsoNormal">On 29 September 1941 the Kitchen Front gave more advice - <font size="3"><i>To make a jam filling, in cakes or sandwiches, go further I am advising people to mix with the jam an equal quantity of carrots cooked and mashed � or better still raw and grated. There�s plenty of sugar in carrots. &nbsp;For a new flavour try adding a little cocoa sometimes</i>.&nbsp;</font>
<p>On 5 September it was advice on Carrots Storage:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-style: italic">HOW TO STORE CARROTS. The secret of storing carrots is in lifting them (pulling th</span><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="photos/carrotclamp.gif" align="right" width="340" height="227" alt="Carrot Clamp for storage" /></font><span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-style: italic">em up) in good condition. Lift them during dry weather, not later than the middle of October. Reject all blemished carrots and all damaged or forked roots. It is not necessary to clean them, but be careful to see they are quite dry. You will need a dry shed for your storing, if possible with a stone or concrete floor, and some slightly moist sand. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-style: italic">If you cannot get sand, earth, taken from the top of the ground, shaken through a very fine sieve and slightly moistened, is the best substitute. Lay alternate rows of carrots and sand (or earth), either on the ground, in a pyramid shape, or in boxes. Cover your pyramid or box with sand (or earth). Put over it a layer of straw as a safeguard against frost. The carrots should be stored crown to tail in rows. Use the carrots as you require them, but take care that the remaining pile is always well covered. It is a wise plan to rebuild your pyramid at least once during the winter.</span></p>

<p>While much of the credit for the campaign went to Lord Woolton, the Minister of Food fro<img border="0" src="photos/ww2rawvcook.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="6" width="245" height="285" alt="ww2 newspaper advert carrots raw or cooked" />m 1940 to 1943,&nbsp; Professor John Raeburn ran it until the end of the war and was responsible for its continuing success. At one point there was a glut of carrots, and the Government let it be known that carotene, which can actually to help night vision (if you are otherwise deficient in Vitamin A), was largely responsible for the RAF's increasing success in shooting down enemy bombers.</p>
<p>The Ministry issued many cooking leaflets, often dedicated to specific topics such as the magic of carrots. The language used was practical, and realistic for the time -- in listing ingredients for suggested recipes, the government leaflets would often say beside an ingredient such as butter: "if possible."</p>
<p>Cooking demonstrations by women such as Marguerite Patten were held in many stores, including Harrods. Educational short movies on cooking were made for showing at cinemas; BBC Radio ran a morning radio programme called "Kitchen Front", broadcast from studios in Oxford Street, London.</p>
<p>They even came up with a recipe using carrot tops (the leaves) - Carrot Top and Potato soup. <a href="carrotops.html">See extract here.</a></p>
<p>Carrots were a relatively cheap foodstuff and not rationed. There was a free market for carrots until the end of October 1941.&nbsp; After that time the Government took over the sole purchase of "all sound marketable carrots fit for human consumption, grown on holdings of one acre and above". The price was fixed, nationwide, excluding the cost of bags. <i>(source Ministry of Agriculture archives, March, 1941 - National Archives UK).</i></p>
<p>In 1941 they cost an average of 2 (pre-decimal) pence a pound, retail. The selling prices was however were strictly controlled by government orders. For example in 1942 the Ministry issued the "Emergency Powers Defence (Food) Carrots Order" which dictated that retailers or any description had to display the maximum selling price at all times - maximum price was then 3 1/2 pence per pound. (2 pence a pound by 1943) The maximum price a grower could sell to a retailer was 9 shilling and 3 pence per hundredweight (plus delivery charge). - extract here:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="photos/maxprice1.jpg" width="561" height="305" alt="ww2 carrots food order" /></p>
<p>Retailers were also required, by law, to maintain accurate records of where they had purchased any carrots from&nbsp; the weight and at what price. There were also strict controls over the weighing of carrots to ensure "no extraneous matter" was included in the weight i.e. soil or green material. <i>source: Ministry of Food archives, 1941, National Archives UK)</i></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The main carrot varieties grown during the war, in the UK, were Nantes, Chantenay, Marshall�s Red Heart, Early Scarlet Horn, Altringham (long), Demi-longue a forcer, James Scarlet Intermediate (maincrop), Long Red Surrey (St Valery) Primo (early) Selected (maincrop). <i><font size="2">(source Gardenorganic, UK)</font></i></font></p>
<hr color="#000000" size="3" />
<p><i><b>"Carrots Help you See in the Dark"</b></i> was a popular saying at the time and people eagerly tucked in to carrots, believing this would help them to see more clearly in the blackout. This suggestion not only helped reduce the surplus vegetables but also helped, in a small way, to mask the chief reason for the RAF's success in night time air battles - the increasing power of radar and the secret introduction of an airborne version of the system.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">It is true</font> that carrots can help keep your eyes healthy and if you are otherwise deficient in Vitamin A, will help you see better in the dark by aiding optimum night vision and defeating night blindness. So, if you don't get enough carotene or Vitamin A in your diet, eventually you will suffer problems in your vision.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">It is true</font> that the RAF/Ministry of information used the campaign to put the Germans off the scent of the discovery of air borne radar and did some experiments with the effect of consumption carrots with high carotene content.</p>
<p>Note: Carrots cannot improve your eyesight&nbsp; -&nbsp; even �Dr. Carrot� was depicted wearing glasses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">The full story of the "See in the Dark" Campaign is on a <a href="ww2seeinthedark.html">separate page - here.</a></font></p>
<p>The Ministry of Food promoted carrots heavily as a substitute for other less readily available vegetables, fruit and other commodities. To improve its image of blandness, people were encouraged to enjoy the healthy carrot in different ways by promoting various recipes never tried before, such as curried carrot and carrot jam. They even promoted the use of carrot tops (the leaves) in a recipe called Champ (a meal for six for a shilling) and Carrot Top and Potato Soup.&nbsp; (These can be found in the&nbsp; World War Two page here <font face="Arial"><a href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/carrotops.html#ww2tops">(see the transcript on the carrot Tops page here)</a></font>&nbsp; .</p>

<p>The Ministry of Food produced several informative cookery leaflets including one specifically dedicated to carrots&nbsp; <a title="Copy of the orginal World War Two Carrots Cookery Leaflet - opens in new window" href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/ww2leaflet.html" target="_blank">(see official carrot cookery leaflet here)</a> . People were encouraged to enjoy the healthy carrot in different ways by the introduction of Dr Carrot in a series of magazine articles and posters. A transcript of the actual broadcast about Carrots <a href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/ww2kitchencarrots.pdf">is here</a> (pdf).</p>
<p>Every morning at 8.15 on the Home Service (UK radio 4) there was a Kitchen Front broadcast giving useful ti<b><img align="right" src="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/drcarrotgif.gif" border="0" width="288" height="344" alt="dr carrot ww2" /></b>ps about using food in different ways, substitute ingredients and recipes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Carrot Competition</b> - Carrots and potatoes featured regularly in the broadcasts, so much so, that on 18 December 1941 they announced a Carrot Competition where the public were to enter to show off their ingenuity and submit ideas,&nbsp; not only for use as a vegetable but also in jelly, cakes and confectionary. The concept was to give the Ministry of Food's experimental kitchen some new ideas for inclusion in&nbsp; its leaflets, for free, and to make people feel part of the effort.</p>
<p>The winner was a Mrs Casey from Palmers Green with "Carrot Savoury Pudding."&nbsp; There was no prize - it was war time! but Mrs Casey did receive the standard BBC Guest broadcast fee as a thank you.&nbsp; The winner was announced as the headline for the Kitchen Front broadcast made on 24 January 1942 -</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;�Carrot Competition Winner Announced�. The Ministry of Food, emerging from behind the mountain of entries they have received for this competition, have just decided that the winning entry came from Mrs Marjorie Casey, 131 Connaught Gardens, Palmers green. The recipe is for �Carrot Savoury Pudding� and was endorsed by everyone judging � and even endorsed by a dismal visitor who has previously stated: �if you mention carrot to me again � I shall scream.�</i></p>
<p><a href="carrotcomp.pdf">See the transcript of the interview with Mrs Casey here</a> (pdf)</p>
<p>Here is the simple recipe - make a suet pudding mixture, but before moistening add 2lbs of chopped up carrots. Now cut in small pieces 2 sticks of celery, half an onion or a leek, and half a turnip. And if you have any small left-over pieces of cooked meat, put these in too. Then add a tablespoonful of mixed herbs, and two tablespoons of chopped parsley, salt and pepper. Moisten in the usual way and steam for 2 � hours. Then serve with a good brown gravy, mashed potato and green vegetable.</p>
<p>Coincidentally this recipe (shown below)&nbsp; appeared in a subsequent <a href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/ww2leaflet.html">Ministry leaflet No 4 Carrots</a>,&nbsp; and is believed to be it based on Mrs Casey's winner.</p>

<p>Other culinary uses included carrot jam,&nbsp; marmalade and toffee carrots.

Read more about jam <a href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/jam.html">here</a></p>
<p>Also during the war many thousands of tons of carrots were dehydrated and shipped overseas in sealed metal containers in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide or nitrogen to prevent loss of carotene.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Food campaign to encourage people to eat more vegetables resulted in the promotion of <font color="#FF0000">Woolton Pie</font>, composed entirely of vegetables. Potato, Carrot and Swede (rutabaga) provided the basic ingredients, with onion and cauliflower added when available. <font face="Arial">Lord Woolton&nbsp;was the Minister of Food from April 1940.</font></p>
<p>The recipe was the creation of Francis Latry, the chef of the Savoy hotel, and named after Lord Woolton.&nbsp; Many people had their own interpretation of this recipe, but they always used carrots! Basically it is mixed vegetables, a sauce and a topping , which could be pastry or potatoes mashed or sliced.&nbsp; Potato Pete's recipe book, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/food/ww2/pete">on line here.</a></p>

The Dr. Carrot character carried a bag labelled "Vit A" as the Ministry of Food recognised the value of the carrot in providing high levels of this vital vitamin, via beta-carotene. People were encouraged to "take the doctor's advice" and eat more carrots to be fit for the ensuing winter. It was reported that the shortage of batteries would no longer be a concern as people would "develop cats eyes" and see better in the dark. Carrot were considered to be the most important of vegetables from a health point of view and it was hoped that Dr Carrot would carry out his mission as successfully as Potato Pete did for the potato. <i>(source: Ministry of Food archives, 1941, National Archives UK)</i>
<p>In February 1941 the Minister of Food gave his monthly report on the food situation in the UK and stated "That the consumption of carrots has increased following the Ministry's publicity campaigns.&nbsp; Supplies are still ample." <i>(source: National Archives, Cabinet papers)</i></p>
<p>In wartime Britain children would very often use the humble carrot as a substitute for the fruit they could no longer obtain. Similarly the Government also issued a poster with the slogan 'Carrots keep you healthy and help you see in the blackout' to promote the humble carrot.<br />

<p><b><a name="surplus"></a>A Surplus of Carrots!</b><a href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/ww2leaflet.html"><img align="right" alt="Ministry of Food Carrots Leaflet" src="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/ww2a11.jpg" border="0" vspace="3" width="196" height="238" /></a> - <font size="2"><i>(Source: National Archives records, inspected September 2011 &amp; September 2013))</i></font></p>
<p>The Ministry of Food encouraged so much extra production that, by January 1942, it was looking for a market for the 100,000 tons of carrots that were surplus to consumers' requirements even at a time when green vegetables were not too plentiful and were expensive in the shops. Such was the success of the domestic agriculture reorganisation, that the crop was 3 times bigger than any in living memory!&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no regulation of the type of carrots to grow and most stayed with a reliable favourite - Nantes type whilst others preferred James Intermediate, depending on soil conditions.</p>
<p>The surplus tonnage, which was "no more than a provident margin in wartime" was offered to farmers for stock feeding at less than half the price guaranteed to the growers.&nbsp; Famously, the Government responded to a temporary wartime oversupply of carrots by suggesting that the RAF's exceptional night-flying was due to eating carotene. The ruse worked <i>(and was in certain circumstances true!)</i>: consumption of carrots increased sharply because people thought carrots might help them see in the blackout, thus taking the pressure off other food supplies. <a href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/history4.html#nightvision">read more about night vision here.</a></p>
<p>In an attempt to prevent malpractice the carrots sold for stock feeding were sprayed with a violet dye, before delivery (in the same way as the surplus potatoes sold for stock feeding at the end of 1940).&nbsp; Carrots made good food for dairy cows, horses. fattening bullocks, and pigs, and if there were more carrots in the country than human consumers could take, it was right that they should be used for stock-feeding.</p>
<p>The Daily Mirror in January 1942 ran with this piece -</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="photos/ww2richcarr.JPG" width="573" height="221" alt="ww2 advert how to get rich on carrots" /></p>
<p>This dye was harmless to animals, and therefore probably ok for humans, and no doubt many found their way into the food chain via the black market economy, which was rife at the time.</p>
<p>So in a bizarre way purple carrots were around in the 40's !</p>
<p>Companies were coming forward all the time with creative ideas to help out the Ministry of Food. Here is an extract from correspondence from the Delma Canning Company in 1943:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/nat6.jpg" border="0" width="726" height="245" alt="ww2 archive ton of carrots" /></p>
<p align="left">The Ministry archive papers also pointed out that the above processes could utilise sub-standard carrots previously "wasted" in their use as animal fodder.&nbsp; The "treacle" referred to was apparently well liked by children as it was so sweet. <font size="3">It was estimated that one ton of carrots produced 1 hundredweight of treacle and that the company promoting its production claimed that it "was a better use than mere cattle fodder".</font></p>
<p align="left">There was considerable debate in the Ministry of Food about the true motives of the company promoting the production of treacle as this extract from a Ministry Committee from December 1943 shows</p>
<blockquote><i><font size="3">The firm claimed to be able to extract 150 grammes (about 6 ozs.) of Vitamin A from every ton of carrots, this being about fifteen times the highest quantity which people with the best scientific equipment have been able to obtain. I should, therefore, require considerable evidence before was prepared to accept this claim at its race value. So far from being given any evidence, the staff were particularly secretive and refused to give any information at all.</font></i>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><i><font size="3">I gather that this firm has processed surplus carrots in the past and obtained carrot treacle, which has been sold as artificial honey probably at a high price, and also pectin, probably sold to jam manufacturers. You will see that the firm has, therefore, done considerable business in products to be obtained from carrots. Since the suggested vitamin process would only take 6 ozs. out of each ton of carrots, one naturally wonders what is to become of the remaining 19 cwts. 111 lbs. 10 ozs.</font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><i><font size="3">&nbsp;</font></i></p>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><font size="3"><i>The answer is obvious - that it will be used to manufacture carrot treacle and pectin, which will be sold by this firm as it has been before. I am very suspicious of the firm's claim to be able to manufacture Vitamin A, and even if their claim were substantiated I would still regard vitamin manufacture as a by-product rather than the main object of the Company. My feeling was that this was being used as an excuse to obtain carrots for treacle and pectin manufacture which, without this excuse, they would be unable to obtain. Finally, even if their claims were genuine, there is no reason why they should not employ broken carrots, as these would be quite suitable for their purpose except that they would require more trouble in washing and additional labour in trimming.&nbsp; I would strongly resist this demand for sound carrot unless the supply is particularly abundant." source National Archives</i></font></div>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">It was reported to the Ministry of Food in 1941 that "There had been a marked improvement in the general character of the diet. There will be a natural tendency for people to eat fewer carrots unless the publicity campaign is carried out with considerable effort. Fortunately a strong appeal can be made to the public to eat carrots as a healthful food."</p>
<p align="left">The Ministry also explored the possibility of manufacturing <b>carrot powder and a carrot spread</b>, similar to margarine, as ways of effectively using the surplus. <font size="3">Breakfast Food and Powder - it was claimed by the manufacturer, Sun-o-Like Co Ltd, that one pound of the product contained the equivalent of one pound of carrots and the corresponding carotene content.&nbsp; After exploring many options the conclusion was that any surplus remaining after increased public consumption would be passed over to the Ministry of Agriculture as raw roots for the feeding of livestock.</font><font size="2"><i>&nbsp;</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">People were encouraged to use Carrot tops (the leaves) too!</font> -&nbsp;&nbsp; Carrot tops had other uses: They even promoted the use of carrot tops (the leaves) in a recipe called Champ (a meal for six for a shilling) and Carrot Top and Potato Soup.&nbsp; (These can be found in the&nbsp; World War Two page here <font face="Arial"><a href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/carrotops.html#ww2tops">(see the transcript on the carrot Tops page here)</a></font>&nbsp; .They were also fed to the rabbits that many people kept in their back gardens for free and off-ration meat.</p>
<hr color="#000000" size="3" />
<p><font color="#FF0000">Here are some more contemporary ingenious uses for the surplus of carrots:</font></p>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><font size="3">Concentrated juice as "honey"; drying carrots for cattle feed in future years and the preparation of pectin.</font>
<p><font size="3">A further suggestion was that carrots could used to manufacture vitamin preparations for post-war relief. The Red Cross had proposed Vitaminised chocolate, and by margarine producers who would otherwise be using a Vitamin A concentrate.</font></p>
</div>
<p>In 1943, the Ministry of Food discussed the options for using carotene obtained from carrots in "Vitaminised chocolate", which would help with the surplus of carrots prevailing at that time. <font size="2">&nbsp;(correspondence extract late1943)</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/nat7.jpg" border="0" width="826" height="218" alt="ww2 archive vitaminised chocolate" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><font size="3">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><font size="3">Having re-examined the statistics the Committee considered that</font></p>
<blockquote><i><font size="3">�There would be no supplies of carrots available for the purposes proposed as the 1943 yield was much lower than in recent years, and the supply of carrots would fall short of normal human consumption, adding that the acreage was about 21,000 compared to the estimated requirement&nbsp; of 33,000 acres for 1944."</font></i></blockquote>
<p>An early suggestion for the manufacture of carrot juice was also a suggestion which was not pursued. The Ministry's official response was that "<b>Carrot juice</b> is of relatively low vitamin value (!) and when concentrated to a syrup has no greater food value than that of the sugar it contains".&nbsp; Subsequently the question of juice was back on the agenda, following information on what the US was doing in that area <i><font size="2">(November 1941)</font></i>:</p>

<p><i>Pommace is a by product of cider production. In the Middle Ages, pommace wine with a low alcohol content of three or four percent was widely available. This faux wine was made by adding water to pommace and then fermenting it. Generally, medieval wines were not fermented to dryness; consequently the pommace would retain some residual sugar after fermenting.<br />

<p>In late 1941, Walt Disney offered to help the British Government promote carrots as a nutritious food source. England had already been at war with the Germans for two years and severe rationing measures were in effect.<img border="0" src="photos/wooltonfdisney1sm.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="315" height="270" alt="ww2 carroty george meets lord woolton" /> The January 11, 1942 issue of The New York Times Magazine announced: "England has a goodly store of carrots. But carrots are not the staple items of the average English diet. The problem...is to sell the carrots to the English public."</p>
<p>Hank Porter, a leading Disney cartoonist&nbsp; designed a family of carrot characters on behalf of England's Food Minister (Lord Woolton).</p>
<p>The Disney Corporation created a carrot family including Carroty George, Clara Carrot, and Dr. Carrot, for the British media to promote the eating of carrots. The vegetable characters were reproduced on a poster, recipe booklet, flyers and the images were used extensively in a newspaper campaign. Carroty George's motto was "I'll tell you what to do with me"! <i><font size="2">(Photo right - Walt Disney Studios help with the ministry's wartime food campaigns, 14th November 1941 - Photo by M.

<br />
You will need:<br />
4 tablespoons of finely grated carrot<br />
1 gelatine leaf<br />
orange essence or orange squash<br />
a saucepan and a flat dish<br />
<br />
Put the carrots in a pan and cook them gently in just enough water to keep them covered, for ten minutes. Add a little orange essence, or orange squash to flavour the carrot. Melt a leaf of gelatine and add it to the mixture. Cook the mixture again for a few minutes, stirring all the time. Spoon it into a flat dish and leave it to set in a cool place for several hours. When the "fudge" feels firm, cut it into chunks and get eating!&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A Modern Version</b></p>
<p>Carrot Fudge</p>
<p>Ingredients 150ml condensed milk 100g sugar 25g golden syrup 75g butter 225g grated carrot</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>1. Stir all the time that the mixture is being heated.</p>
<p>2. Use a large heavy pan � Dissolve the sugar and syrup in the milk and add the grated carrots and any flavouring.</p>
<p>3. Boil vigorously, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the sugar thermometer shows the temperature to be 240�F or 115�C. Or if you don�t have such a thing, once it starts to �bond� together, change colour and start to smell like toffee</p>
<p>4. Take care not to splash the mixture which is very hot. But a sticky cooker is inevitable.</p>
<p>5. Take off the heat.</p>
<p>6. Stir in the butter a little at a time.</p>
<p>7. Then pour the mixture into a greased 20cm square tin to cool.</p>
<p>8. Cut into small squares when cold and store in an airtight tin. Or roll into balls and drop in icing sugar</p>
<p>Optional Additional Flavouring: 50g melted plain chocolate (not cooking chocolate) OR 1 tsp cocoa powder OR 1 tsp instant coffee powder OR 1 tbsp orange juice OR 2 drops vanilla essence</p>

<p>Let us hope that the country never faces such extremes again. However, it is now realised that the home population never ate so well as during and after the war. This was thanks to the strict rationing of shop-bought goods and the amount of fresh vegetables that people ate.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF" size="5"><a name="dig for victory"></a>Dig For Victory</font></p>
<p><img width="184" height="366" align="right" alt="Dig For Victory Poster - 2 spade" src="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/Digsm.jpg" border="0" hspace="15" /></p>
<p><img border="0" src="photos/d4vicsymbol.jpg" align="left" width="186" height="186" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="dig for victory ww2 logo" />The Ministry of Food launched its 'Dig for Victory' campaign in October 1939, one month after war broke out. The campaign was led by an agricultural economist, Professor John Raeburn, who was recruited to the Ministry of Food in 1939, and who would run the campaign until the end of the war.</p>
<p>The campaign encouraged people to transform their front and back gardens into vegetable plots. The goal was to replace imported food, thus freeing up shipping space for more valuable war materials, and to make up for food that was sunk in transit. By the end of 1940, 728,000 tons of food making its way to Britain had been lost, sunk by German submarine activity.</p>
<p>The government realised that the population would go hungry if the war was to last longer than a few months. The result was that formal gardens, lawns and even sports pitches were transformed into allotments, large and small, and everybody on the home front was encouraged to become a vegetable gardener.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Whilst the term "Victory Garden" has become synonymous with World War Two, its origin can be traced back to the 1600?s in England where Richard Gardner in his book entitled Victory Gardens wrote:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 36pt"><i>"If any citie or towne should be besieged with the enemy&nbsp; what better provision for the greatest number of people&nbsp; can be than every garden be sufficiently planted with carrots?</i></p>
<p>Prior to World War II, Britain imported over 55 million tons of food a year - much of it from Canada and the USA. After the outbreak of war, merchant vessels carrying provisions into Britain, especially those coming across the Atlantic, became targets of the German navy and food imports were under threat. At the same time the British government recognised that the merchant ships were required for the transport of troops, munitions and even aeroplanes to the theatres of war.</p>
<p>In October 1939 Rob Hudson, Minister for Agriculture, announced "We want not only the big man with the plough but the little man with the spade to get busy this autumn... Let 'Dig for Victory' be the motto of everyone with a garden". It was a desperate request because farmers could only produce 30% of the country's food. But if gardens could be turned over to growing food rather than flowers, up to 25% of the necessary vegetables could be provided.</p>
<p>The whole of Britain's home front was encouraged to transform private gardens into mini-allotments. Not only this, but parks, formal public gardens and various areas of unused land were dug up for planting fruit and vegetables. Kensington Gardens dug up its flowers and planted rows of cabbages and carrots. All over the country, lawns were dug and potatoes, cabbages, carrots and beans planted. Windsor Great Park was given over to wheat, and public parks, road verges, railway embankments, golf clubs, tennis courts, roofs and even window boxes were put to work. <img width="272" height="399" align="left" alt="Dr Carrot and Potato Pete Poster" src="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/drcposter.jpg" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="10" /></p>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture got in on the act producing several informative leaflets on how to grow more. Leaflet number one "Grow for Winter as well as Summer" which showed how to get fresh, home grown vegetables throughout the year.&nbsp; Copies can be seen here.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/digleaflet1a.jpg">Front page</a> and <a href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/digleaflet2a.jpg">inside</a> page.&nbsp; The plan worked and by 1945, around 75% of food was produced in Britain.</p>
<p>A song was introduced to promote the Dig for Victory slogan.</p>
<p>Dig! Dig! Dig! And your muscles will grow big<br />
Keep on pushing the spade<br />
Don't mind the worms<br />
Just ignore their squirms<br />
And when your back aches laugh with glee<br />
And keep on diggin?<br />
Till we give our foes a Wiggin?<br />
Dig! Dig! Dig! to Victory"<br />
<br />
Dig for Victory was very successful. From a total of 815,000 allotments in 1939 the number rose to 1,400,000 by 1943.</p>
<p>Most of the nutrition in carrot taproots in the storage cells of the cortex, the darkly pigmented layer surrounding the core of water conducting xylem cells. Victory garden crops were grown to maximum size, and thus after months of growth, a cambium layer formed around the original xylem core of herbaceous carrot roots. Cell divisions in the cambium increased root diameter by developing secondary xylem, also known as wood; in short, carrots became hard and tough when they were grown for an entire season.</p>
<p>However, they could be combined in infinite ways with cabbage and potatoes, two other highly productive crops that could be harvested at will. For instance, in a wartime version of the Irish dish known as champ, cooked carrots and cabbage were mounded on mashed potatoes and seasoned with salt, pepper, and a bit of margarine. Countless other British recipes relied on the vegetable trio of carrots, cabbages, and potatoes.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was reported in the UK Times on 15 May 1941 that "Evidence of American determination to help Britain in every possible way is provided by the offer of vegetable seeds".&nbsp; These were accepted by Mr. R. S. Hudson, Minister of Agriculture. The first instalment of nine tons arrived through the agency of the British War Relief Society.&nbsp; Among the vegetables which have been specially asked for are onions, <font color="#FF0000">carrots</font>, beans. cauliflower, broccoli, leeks, parsnips, and tomatoes.</p>
<p>Very soon allotment holders, members of the Army and Royal Air Force, and others were sowing American seeds on their plots.</p>

Left the Official US leaflet issued February 1942.</p>
<p>Victory gardens were vegetable gardens planted to ensure an adequate food supply for civilians and troops. Government agencies, private foundations, businesses, schools, and seed companies all worked together to provide land, instruction, and seeds for individuals and communities to grow food.<br />
<img align="right" src="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/usvicgdn2.jpg" border="0" width="262" height="311" alt="ww2 advert victory garden" /><br />
From California to Florida, Americans ploughed backyards, vacant lots, parks, baseball fields, and schoolyards to set out gardens. Children and adults fertilized, planted, weeded, and watered in order to harvest an abundance of vegetables. (<a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/house/yourvisit/victorygarden.asp" target="_blank">read more at the Smithsonian website here</a>)</p>
<p>At the beginning of World War II, Secretary of Agriculture Wickard suggested that, since the farmers of America would be busy feeding the army, civilians should plant Victory Gardens to provide fresh vegetables for their own tables. Americans were quick to respond. By 1943, victory gardens were flourishing in many backyards, empty lots, parks, baseball fields, schoolyards - even parking lots, since not many cars were being driven due to the shortage of gasoline. These gardens came in every size and shape. Governments and corporations promoted the victory garden effort as a call for self-reliance.</p>
<p>People in both rural and urban areas tilled the soil to raise food for their families, friends and neighbours. Households used what they needed and preserved and canned for future use. Eventually more than 40 percent of the country's vegetables were grown in the nation's backyards. Victory gardening enabled more processed foods to be shipped to our troops around the world. Emphasis was placed on making gardening a family or community effort - not drudgery, but a pastime, and a national duty.</p>
<p>By 1944, 20 million Americans planted Victory Gardens, producing one million tons a year of vegetables -- about half the amount consumed in America. Of course carrots figured highly in the campaigns, as evidenced by the various propaganda posters. <a href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/dig4victory.html">Click here to see more posters.</a><img align="right" alt="Dig for plenty poster" src="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/dig3.jpg" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="15" width="195" height="300" /></p>
<p>Brightly coloured posters produced for the government by artists from the Work Progress Administration (WPA) encouraged Americans to "Fight with Food." Vegetables grown in home gardens, the government reasoned, would not only lighten the burden of food rationing, but would free up supplies needed for troops fighting in Europe. The appealing combination of self-sufficiency and patriotism made the Victory Garden effort arguably the most successful civilian wartime program.</p>

<p>Pictured right, "Dig for Plenty" by Le Bon, 1944, Gouache on board. A Ministry of Agriculture food production poster using the slogan "Dig for Plenty'. Illustrated with a colourful box of winter vegetables, it is aimed at the amateur gardener, rather than industrial agriculturalists. ?Dig for Victory' was a campaign that ran throughout much of the war. The famous ?foot on the spade' illustration, visible in the bottom left-hand corner, took on a life of its own early in the war. The benefits of growing one's own food were stressed. Such over-heightened colour visions of abundant vegetables, rarely fruit or salad, but good nutritious food in a time of shortages, would have appealed to the public.</p>
<p>"Dig for Plenty" indicates a recognition that victory was already assured and now a healthier future was possible. Previous campaigns had seen many gardens turned into allotments. Those who dug up half their lawn for vegetables had done it partly in response to the government campaign and partly because they feared rises in food prices. It was also a leisure interest. In 1944, the campaign no longer called for extra allotments and was directed almost entirely to greater efficiency in vegetable production.</p>
<p>The most common carrot varieties used by US citizens were Amsterdam Minicor and Autumn King.</p>
<p>Also an extract of carrots was used in America to colour Oleos (margarine) during the fats rationing that took place during the second world war. (They were really reviving an early American folk custom in colouring foods.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FF0000">Carrots -&nbsp; Yorkshire Pudding</font>&nbsp;<i>Daily Mirror 11 December 1941</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nowadays, when you have to economise with your Yorkshire pudding, you will find this method an improvement. Make your batter with half milk, half water, or a little tinned evaporated milk added to the water. Add one large raw grated carrot to the baiter before you bake it.</p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial">Carrots were one vegetable in plentiful supply and as a result widely utilised as a substitute for the scarce commodities. To improve its blandness, people were encouraged to 'enjoy' the healthy carrot in different ways by the introduction of such characters as 'Do</font></span><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial">ctor Carrot'. Culinary delights in the form of curried carrot, carrot jam and a homemade drink called Carrolade</font></span> <font face="Arial">(carolene) <span lang="en-us">were suggested by the Ministry of Food. <a href="http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/ww2leaflet.html">(See the official leaflet here)</a></span></font></p>
<p>The home made drink called Carrolade (also known a carolene), regarded as a substitute for orange juice, was made from the juice of sugared (if available), grated carrots and Swedes pressed through a muslin - clearly no one thought of just plain carrot juice!</p>
<p>Other culinary uses included carrot marmalade and toffee carrots. The humble carrot, previously thought to be only good for animal feed had been elevated to a new high and kick started its rightful return to one of the nations favourite vegetables.</p>
<p>Also during the war many thousands of tons of carrots were dehydrated and shipped overseas in sealed metal containers in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide or nitrogen to prevent loss of carotene.</p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Carrots for Breakfast</font></b></p>
<p>(suggested by a radio listener)</p>
<p>Slice up two carrots and cook the rounds with bacon. The bacon fat makes them tender in no time.</p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Carrot Fudge</font></b> <i><font size="2">(Recipe from Colleen Moulding's "Frugal Recipes from Wartime Britain").</font></i><br />
<br />
You will need:<br />
4 tablespoons of finely grated carrot</p>
<p>1 gelatine leaf<br />
orange essence or squash<br />
a saucepan and a flat dish<br />
<br />
Method: Put the carrots in a pan and cook them gently in just enough water to keep them covered, for ten minutes. Add a little orange essence, or orange squash to flavour the carrot. Melt a leaf of gelatine and add it to the mixture. Cook the mixture again for a few minutes, stirring all the time. Spoon it into a flat dish and leave it to set in a cool place for several hours. When the "fudge" feels firm, cut it into chunks and get eating!</p>

But be careful not to burn it, take quickly from flame as soon as it has the required colour. Add at once I gill of water, 4 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1lb of grated or minced carrots.</p>
<p>Soak the carrots in cold water, scrub them with a hard brush, then grate or mince them. Cook gently until the carrots are done. Then add 1 gill of milk, 1 heaped teaspoon dry breadcrumbs and 3 teaspoons of cornflour (or better, vanilla custard powder) which you have dissolved in a little cold water or milk.</p>
<p>Cook gently for a few minutes. Pour into a wetted mould. Turn out when cooled.- If you wish, serve with a little cold milk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Carrots provide an excellent change in the taste of dishes which you used to make with tomato or its sauce.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(c) Parboil sliced carrots preferably with a little chopped onion and cover any cooked, baked or steamed fish with this mixture. &nbsp;Best method a a little margarine or lard and chopped onion, if possible, to cooked sliced carrots in a saucepan. Add filleted fish sprinkled with salt and pepper to the boiling carrots and simmer in this way for 8-10 minutes.</p>
