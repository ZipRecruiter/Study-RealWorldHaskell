<p>New research suggests that oranges, grapes and carrots may contain cancer-fighting compounds that closely resemble those used in licensed drugs, says Brinkwire.</p>
<p>The study, led by Dr. Kirill Veselkov from the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College London, found that of the over 7,900 molecules within fruits and vegetables, 110 have the potential to battle tumors.</p>
<p>This conclusion is based on the molecules� likeness to compounds found in existing anti-cancer medications, explains The Times.</p>
<p>What makes fruits and vegetables act similarly once consumed is their abundance of antioxidants called flavonoids, which give them their colour. read more here. https://bit.ly/2XZcyOo</p>

<p><b>Carrots to be used to reinforce concrete</b> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/vegetables-could-hold-the-key-to-stronger-buildings-and-bridges">here</a>. Carrots make concrete stronger, study finds<br />
<br />
Research funded by the European Union�s Horizon 2020 has found that fibres from vegetables can strengthen concrete.<br />
Normally, concrete is formed of water, aggregate and Portland cement, but researchers found that adding tiny �nanosized� platelets from beetroots and carrots creates a stronger mixture by increasing the amount of calcium silicate hydrate generated, which is the product that strengthens concrete.<br />
<br />
The vegetable extract strengthened the mixture so well that 40kg less Portland cement was needed per cubic metre of concrete. Lancaster University and company Cellucomp conducted the study.The team found that concrete containing vegetable composites surpassed mixes with additives like graphene and carbon nanotubes.<br />
<br />
The vegetable additive is also cheaper and can be sourced from food waste.Prof. Mohamed Saafi, lead researcher, said: �The composites are not only superior to current cement products in terms of mechanical and microstructure properties but also use smaller amounts of cement.<br />
<br />
�This significantly reduces both the energy consumption and CO2 emissions associated with cement manufacturing.�<br />
Future research will determine if existing concrete structures could be reinforced with sheets made from vegetable nanoplatelets.<br />
<br />
Cellucomp currently uses root vegetable fibres to produce longer lasting paint.</p>

<p>Carrots hold key to beating cancer, say scientists</p>
<p>CARROTS could be key to beating cancer, according to scientists.</p>
<p>By: Jo Willey Published: Fri, June 20, 2014 (UK Daily Express)</p>
<p>They contain powerful �cancer-busting chemicals, experts at Newcastle University have found.</p>
<p>The natural compounds, known as poly�acetylenes, protect the plant from attack by pests and diseases. They occur only in veg�etables of the carrot family and a few other closely related species such as ginseng.</p>
<p>Previous tests have shown the compounds can have beneficial effects in tackling inflammation and cancer. They were also found to reduce cancer growth in rats.</p>
<p>Now researchers have launched a three-year study to measure the effects of root vegetables such as carrots, parsnips and celeriac on cancer and inflammatory diseases like arthritis.</p>
<p>A team of food scientists, chemists and �doctors will recruit scores of volunteers to take part in a dietary trial.</p>
<p>Project supervisor Dr Kirsten Brandt, senior lecturer in the university�s School of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, said: �After seeing the positive effects of feeding carrots in the animal experiments, it is important to test if it also works in humans, in particular to find out how much carrot we must eat to obtain a health benefit.�</p>
<p>Dr Wendy Wrieden, of the univers�ity�s Human Nutrition Research �Centre, said: �We know that eating a variety of vegetables and fruit can reduce the risk of some cancers and other chronic diseases.</p>
<p>�Hopefully this work will give us a clearer picture of the role of vegetables and perhaps provide encouragement to the public to eat more.�</p>
<p>Research in China has already shown that carrots, best known for supposedly helping us to see in the dark, can reduce the risk of prostate cancer by a fifth</p>
<p>The team will investigate how much of the poly�acetylenes are absorbed into the body when the vegetables are eaten raw, boiled or fried and in large or small pieces.</p>
<p>The water or oil in which they have been cooked will also be tested to see if there are any health benefits in re-using it in stews or soup.</p>
<p>Previous research by Dr Brandt found that carrots contain the anti-cancer compound falcarinol, which reduced tumours in rats by a third. But falcarinol, like vitamin C and sugar, is soluble and lost when carrots are boiled.</p>
<p>At the time, Dr Brandt said the secret of healthier and tastier carrots was to use a bigger pan so they can be cooked whole.</p>
<p>She said that increases the anti-cancer properties in a cooked portion by 25 per cent.</p>
<p>The latest study is being partly funded by the British Carrot Growers� Association.</p>
<p>Martin Evans, managing director of co-operative Freshgro, said: �It has long been accepted that carrots are very good for us but this research project will go much further in improving our knowledge and awareness of the health benefits of this group of root vegetables.�</p>
<p>Research in China has already shown that carrots, best known for supposedly helping us to see in the dark, can reduce the risk of prostate cancer by a fifth. Men who ate carrots at least three times a week were 18 per cent less likely to develop a tumour.</p>
<p>And in the US, researchers at Harvard University found women who ate at least five carrots a week were nearly two-thirds less likely to have a stroke than those who ate them only once a month.</p>

<p><b>February 2014 - California - Search for the perfect carrot</b></p>
<p>Researchers and carrot industry representatives recently met at the University of California Desert Research &amp; Extension Center to evaluate a number of carrot breeds.For a consumer, the perfect carrot would likely be nutritious, taste good and look good. Carrot growers have additional criteria. For instance, carrot tops � the leafy green bushels that sprout from the tops of the carrots�need to be strong enough to withstand harvesting machinery, said Rob Kane, a research laboratory technician with the University of Wisconsin.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">�The equipment is built to handle the crop,� he said. �And, the crop is built to withstand the equipment.� To ease home storage, growers favor carrots that are not longer than the width of a refrigerator drawer. �You want them to be accessible to whoever is at home,� Kane said. The carrot market has changed markedly over the years, and with it, the carrot.Growers select the type and number of seeds with an end-product in mind. Seeds selected for the cut-and-peel market � baby carrots � are planted closely together to restrict the diameter of the plant and encourage it to grow downward, said Phil Simon, researcher with United States Department of Agriculture and professor of horticulture at University of Wisconsin.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Baby carrots are geared toward production. Most baby carrots on the market are cut and whittled down from longer carrots. Those with a constant diameter are preferable to those that are tapered. Researchers are now trying to get more carrot segments out of every harvest. �When the baby industry started, they wanted three cuts. Now they�re trying to increase length,� Simon said. �Adding one more cut to a three-cut carrot gives you a 33 percent yield increase.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even a carrot�s appearance can have an impact on production. The smoother a carrot is, the easier it is to process, according to Shelby Ellison, a post-doctoral researcher in Simon�s lab. With all the talk about ease of production, the importance of flavor is not lost on researchers. �Sweetness is most important. Kids like a sweet flavor,� said Massimo Iorizzo, also a post-doctoral researcher in Simon�s lab.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Simon is presently sequencing the carrot genome to establish a framework for the industry to more easily grow carrots with desirable attributes, like sugar accumulation and pest resistance. Researchers are also working on bringing novelty carrots mainstream. Red and purple carrots are oftentimes heirloom varieties �not particularly adapted to conditions here,� Simon said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Purple carrots are believed to originate in Turkey. Red carrots are believed to originate in China or Japan. �Those (red) carrots are cooked, so they don�t care about the flavor,� he said. For Paul Bender, an account manager with Nunhems, said that consumer demand for a convenient product is the main reason that the market has changed from fresh carrots to cut-and-peel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And, while retailers are now driving the demand for colored carrots, the limiting factors are still the varieties and choices available. However, red carrots may soon be found on supermarket shelves. �Red is now a consistently good flavor,� Kane said. �They tried (to market) it a few years ago but it didn�t have a good flavor.�</p>

<p><b><a name="better"></a>Carrots used to be better!</b> - Vegetables grown decades ago were much richer in vitamins and minerals than the varieties most of us get today. The main culprit in this disturbing nutritional trend is soil depletion: Modern intensive agricultural methods have stripped increasing amounts of nutrients from the soil in which the food we eat grows. Sadly, each successive generation of fast-growing, pest-resistant carrot is truly less good for you than the one before.</p>
<p>A landmark study on the topic by Donald Davis and his team of researchers from the University of Texas (UT) at Austin�s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry was published in December 2004 in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition. They studied U.S. Department of Agriculture nutritional data from both 1950 and 1999 for 43 different vegetables and fruits, finding �reliable declines� in the amount of protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, riboflavin (vitamin B2) and vitamin C over the past half century. Davis and his colleagues chalk up this declining nutritional content to the preponderance of agricultural practices designed to improve traits (size, growth rate, pest resistance) other than nutrition.</p>
<p>The Organic Consumers Association cites several other studies with similar findings: A Kushi Institute analysis of nutrient data from 1975 to 1997 found that average calcium levels in 12 fresh vegetables dropped 27 percent; iron levels 37 percent; vitamin A levels 21 percent, and vitamin C levels 30 percent. A similar study of British nutrient data from 1930 to 1980, published in the British Food Journal, found that in 20 vegetables the average calcium content had declined 19 percent; iron 22 percent; and potassium 14 percent.</p>
<p>The key to healthier produce is healthier soil. Alternating fields between growing seasons to give land time to restore would be one important step. Also, foregoing pesticides and fertilizers in favour of organic growing methods is good for the soil, the produce and its consumers. Those who want to get the most nutritious fruits and vegetables should buy regularly from local organic farmers.</p>
<p>Vegetables aren�t as healthy as they used to be doesn�t mean we should avoid them. Vegetables are still extraordinarily rich in nutrients and beneficial phytochemicals and vegetables and fruit are our best sources for these.</p>
<hr color="#FFA500" />
<p><b>The Future - A Rainbow Carrot?</b></p>
<p>How do you get people to eat more carrots? You excite their senses. Surprise them, say, with unexpected colour and explosive flavour. It�s a worthwhile tack to take, says Philipp Simon, plant geneticist at the Vegetable Crops Research Unit in Madison, Wisconsin. He should know. Simon, who heads the ARS laboratory on the University of Wisconsin campus, helped elevate the humble carrot to its current prestigious position. Thanks to work he did with colleagues more than 25 years ago, the carrot is now an even better source of dietary vitamin A.</p>
<p>Using classical breeding methods, they helped boost the veggie�s already abundant stores of beta-carotene by 75 percent. Beta-carotene is what our bodies use to make all-important vitamin A, which is crucial for good eye health and a strong immune system. It�s also responsible for the carrot�s orange hue.</p>
<p>Simon would like to sneak in other nutrients too. That�s why, several years ago, he got to wondering: Why settle for just orange? After all, 700 years ago Western Europeans were feasting on carrots that ranged in colour from lemon-yellow to burgundy to purple. We can have the same variety today�and the healthful antioxidants associated with those brightly coloured pigments.</p>
<p>In addition to breeding yellow, red, deep-orange, purple, and even white carrots, <b>Simon aims to create a �rainbow� carrot</b> - a multi-pigmented root that naturally contains several antioxidants, such as lycopene, lutein, and anthocyanin.</p>

<p><b>Fuel for Cars?</b></p>
<p><b>Scientists now believe that bio fuels will be the answer to our energy needs when the oil runs out. One such fuel, perhaps within 10 years, will be carrots - it would take approximately 6000 carrots to drive one mile.<br /></b><br />
Hopefully, there will be inexpensive retrofits for older cars to convert to alternative fuels. It could cause a whole new problem if used cars started filling up junk yards because everyone decided to buy carrot fuelled cars. It would be much better to make car donations so someone in need could use it.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Scientists unveil New 'super carrot'</b> (from the BBC, Spring 2008)</p>
<p align="left">The new carrot could ward off osteoporosis Scientists in the US say they have created a genetically-engineered carrot that provides extra calcium. They hope that adding the vegetable to a normal diet could help ward off conditions such as brittle bone disease and osteoporosis. Someone eating the new carrot absorbs 41% more calcium than if they ate the old, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study suggests.</p>
<p align="left">The calcium-charged vegetable still needs to go through many safety trials. "These carrots were grown in carefully monitored and controlled environments," said Professor Kendal Hirschi, part of the team at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. Much more research needs to be conducted before this would be available to consumers Professor Kendal Hirschi Baylor College of Medicine "Much more research needs to be conducted before this would be available to consumers." But the scientists nonetheless hope their carrot could ultimately offer a healthier way of consuming sufficient quantities of the mineral.</p>
<p align="left">Dairy foods are the primary dietary source of calcium but some are allergic to these while others are told to avoid consuming too much due to their high fat content. A gene has been altered in the carrot which allows the calcium within it to cross more easily over the plant membranes. On its own, the carrot would not meet the daily requirement of 1,000mg of calcium, but if other vegetables were similarly engineered, intake could be increased dramatically.</p>
<p align="left">It is not the first time the carrot has been tampered with. The orange colour we know is the result of Dutch cultivation in the 17th Century, when patriotic growers turned a vegetable which was then purple into the colour of the national flag. Nor is it the first vegetable to receive a healthy make-over. Genetic engineering is being used to develop potatoes with more starch and less water so that they absorb less oil when fried, producing healthier chips or crisps. Work is also being carried out on broccoli so that it contains more sulforaphane, a chemical which may help people ward off cancer.</p>
<p align="left">Professor Susan Fairweather-Tait of the University of East Anglia said genetically engineering foods to increase their nutrient content was becoming an increasingly important avenue. "People are being told to eat more modestly to prevent weight gain, and many diets now no longer contain everything we need. "There has been great resistance to genetic engineering, but gradually we are moving away from the spectre of 'Frankenstein food' and starting to appreciate the health benefits it may bring."&nbsp; Great news!<img border="0" src="photos/bunch1.jpg" align="right" width="238" height="549" /></p>
<p><b>Also!!</b></p>
<p>Researchers have created a new genetically engineered carrot that has 41 percent more calcium than the regular carrot, reports a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.<br />
<br />
Altering a gene boosts levels of transporter proteins, which pump calcium from the soil into the plant. This kind of technology could help combat conditions like osteoporosis.

<p><b>Standard Carrots -</b> <i>�This marks a new dawn for the curvy cucumber and the knobbly carrot,�</i></p>
<p>European Union bureaucrats are to usher in a new age of acceptance when it comes to knobbly fruit and vegetables, scrapping the rules dictating that only "standard" size carrots can be sold in shops.<img border="0" src="photos/multifang.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" width="385" height="185" alt="Forked Carrot Roots - still edible!" /><br />
<br />
Misshapen and blemished fruit and vegetables are likely to find their way back on to supermarket shelves � although they may be labelled "for cooking" under reforms being proposed by the EU's Danish Agriculture and Rural Development commissioner, Mariann Fischer Boel.<br />
<br />
" We want to have two classes, allowing supermarkets to sell funny shaped vegetables," said Michael Mann, a spokesman for the European Commission.<br />
<br />
Ms Fischer Boel wants to abandon the eccentric rules that brought scorn on the EU and led to criticism that perfectly formed harvests had been achieved at the expense of taste.&nbsp; The rules specify the diameter of carrots that can be sold as class one, unless they are officially regarded as baby carrots.&nbsp; The Commission will now formally adopt the changes which, for practical reasons, will be implemented from 1 July 2009.<br />
<br />
This rule will be scrapped:<br />
<br />
"Carrots - Carrots less than 1.9cm in diameter at the thick end could not be sold as class one, unless marketed as "baby" varieties."</p>

<p><b>The cream-coloured carrot is making a comeback</b></p>
<p>As your browse the vegetable racks in your local store, you could easily mistake them for parsnips. But after four centuries of orange varieties, a cream carrot is to appear in British shops. The new-look version is said to be crisp and crunchy in texture and sweeter in taste than its orange cousin.</p>
<p>A bunch of Creme de Lite, cream-coloured carrots, which will be stocked<img border="0" src="photos/cremedelite.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="468" height="286" /> by Marks &amp; Spencer shops from next week. Marks &amp; Spencer is to stock the carrots, which are organically produced in Scotland. Carrots were originally white, cream and purple, and only became orange coloured through cross-breeding 400 years ago, the store's vegetable expert said.</p>
<p>The orange variety was developed by Dutch growers aiming to produce a less bitter version and was adopted by the royal family in the Netherlands, where orange is the national colour.</p>
<p>However, the new Creme de Lite variety is said to have been specially produced to lack any of the bitterness of the original. It is grown by farmer Steven Jack in the Moray Firth. It can be cooked or eaten raw, just like the orange version of the vegetable.</p>
<p>Marks &amp; Spencer agronomist Dr Simon Coupe said: 'This speciality organic cream carrot is already prized in Europe and America for its crisp and crunchy texture, and is especially good in salads or cooked the same way you would a classic orange carrot.' Previous attempts to revitalise the huge carrot market have been unsuccessful. Sales of purple carrots dropped shortly after they were introduced when customers discovered the colour seeped out of the vegetable and into the cooking water.</p>
<hr color="#FFA500" />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Purple carrots are now propositioned as the next superfood</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The findings of the recent Australian study revealed the ancient carrot to be packed with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory goodness - up to 28 times more anthocyanins, which are antioxidants that are responsible for the purple-red pigment in raspberries and blueberries, than there are in orange carrots.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lindsay Brown, professor of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Southern Queensland who is also the study author said the purple carrots are the original carrots from the ancient Persia. Purple carrots are one of the wide variety of fruit and vegetables that are almost lost in the era of single supermarket varieties, just like other ancient tomato varieties.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While claims have previously been made about its health benefits, there were no tests to back up them, not until just recently. Conducting rat studies using purple carrots grown in Queensland, the rats were given high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet for 16 weeks to mirror the effects of unhealthy Western diet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The rats soon developed high blood pressure, became fatter and glucose-intolerant - or prediabetic - and suffered heart and liver damage. Subsequently, in the second eight weeks, purple carrot juice were added into the rats' diet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The results were a surprise to the scientists, and will be published in the British Journal of Nutrition. Prof Brown said miraculously everything went back to normal. "The blood pressure went down, the collagen in the heart was back to normal, the liver histology was back to normal, the liver enzymes, the glucose tolerance, the fat pads were all back to normal, despite continuing this ... terrible diet," she explained.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Purple carrots should be eaten coupled with a moderate diet and exercise, advised Prof Brown.</p>

<p><b>Food Waste</b> - In industrialised countries, reducing food waste will require raising public awareness and changing consumer attitudes. On Carrot farms, photographic sensors scan all harvested carrots and reject those that are crooked, dull, blemished, too thin or too fat. As a result, 25 to 30 percent of carrots end up as animal feed even though they pose no health risk to humans. Many other fruit and vegetables are also set aside because supermarket managers believe consumers will not buy them for aesthetic reasons.</p>

<p><b><a name="eskimo"></a>Eskimo Carrot&nbsp; F1 the first �green carrot�</b> - Help with Climate Change and Carbon Footprint<br />
<br />
A new carrot, Eskimo F1,&nbsp; has been developed to have a very high degree of tolerance to cold, which means the variety can be grown for an extended period into the UK winter without the usual need for polythene and straw to protect the crop<a href="photos/eskimolge.jpg"><img border="0" src="photos/eskimosm.jpg" alt="Eskimo F1 carrot resistant to frost" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="279" height="255" /></a> against frost. Straw and polythene are the norm in the UK for field storage so by eliminating their use, all the carbon emissions associated with this practice are effectively removed, making the carrot �greener� to grow. Its unique feature of frost tolerance has been the main driving force behind the varieties success and this has developed a blue print for growers to achieve excellent quality, yield and pack out results from open field situations late into the winter.</p>
<p>The main advantage is that growers do not need to protect the Eskimo with costly straw and polythene due to its cold tolerance. This also reduces cost and for organic produces the carbon input of laying on the straw and polythene, taking it off and of course the carbon involved in producing the polythene in the first place.<br />
<br />
Nickerson-Zwaan, the company which has developed the seeds, believe that the level of reduction in carbon emissions associated with open field Eskimo could be significant.&nbsp; By extending the open field season using Eskimo F1, a large proportion of the extra carbon produced by straw and polythene can be avoided, reducing the overall carbon by usage by 56%.<br />
<br />
The main features of Eskimo F1 are:</p>

<p><b>Increased antioxidant capacity of Carrots</b> - Studies suggest that a moderate, 14-second dose of UV-B can boost fresh, sliced carrots� antioxidant capacity by about threefold.</p>
<p>Exposing sliced carrots to UV-B, one of the three kinds of ultraviolet light in sunshine, can boost the antioxidant activity of the colourful, crunchy veggie. That�s according to preliminary studies by Tara H. McHugh, a food technologist and research leader at the ARS Western Regional Research Center in Albany, California, and her team.</p>
<p>Found mainly in fruits and vegetables, antioxidants are natural compounds that may reduce risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>The carrot investigation, conducted by McHugh, postdoctoral associate Wen-Xian Du, and others, suggests that a moderate, 14-second dose of UV-B can boost fresh, sliced carrots� antioxidant capacity by about threefold. The dose is energy-efficient and does not significantly heat or dry the carrots. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jan11/carrots0111.htm">Read more here.</a></p>

<p><b>USDA Replaces MyPyramid with Healthy MyPlate Icon</b> The U.S. Department of Agriculture (<img border="0" src="photos/myplate_lg.jpg" width="227" height="206" align="right" />USDA) released a replacement for its current MyPyramid campaign in support of dietary recommendations from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 to fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. The new healthy plate icon is sectioned off to show fruits and vegetables as half of the plate making the recommendation easy to understand. The new healthy MyPlate icon developed by the USDA supports this concept � fill half your plate with colourful fruits and vegetables at every meal!</p>
<p>Grains &amp; Protein. Grains and protein each represent less than one quarter of the plate. While the protein group was once known as the meat group, over time it has transitioned to incorporate other protein-rich foods such as fish, shellfish, poultry, eggs, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds.</p>
<p>Dairy. The dairy group has been moved to a circle next to the plate and defined as fat-free or low-fat milk or yogurt.</p>
<p>Fruits &amp; Vegetables. The biggest star of the MyPlate debut is fruits and vegetables, winning half the available real estate on the plate.</p>
<p>The plate stresses the key concept of filling half your plate with fruits and vegetables (that doesn�t mean potato chips!). Overall, the new plate image encourages a more plant-based diet.</p>
<p>And the best part � the plate icon is an easy enough tool for children to use too! Children and parents can learn to eat healthfully while sitting around their dinner plates.</p>
<p>Creating a healthy eating plan doesn�t have to be complicated! Instead of worrying about the minor details, focus on these key guidelines:</p>
<p><b>Balancing Calories</b></p>
<p>● Enjoy your food, but eat less. ● Avoid oversized portions.</p>
<p><b>Foods to Increase</b></p>
<p>● Make half your plate fruits and vegetables. ● Make at least half your grains whole grains. ● Switch to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk.</p>
<p><b>Foods to Reduce</b></p>
<p>● Compare sodium in foods like soup, bread, and frozen meals ― and choose the foods with lower numbers. ● Drink water instead of sugary drinks.</p>
<p>Visit MyPlate to create a balanced eating plan specific to you, and take the Pledge to eat MORE fruits and vegetables!</p>

<p>A study published in the February 2012 online issue of the <em>Journal of American Medical Association</em> showed that elementary school students who had a school lunch tray with pictures of vegetables in the compartments where food is served tended to take and eat more vegetables.</p>
<p>The study looked at the number of elementary school kids who took green beans and carrots and consumed them when photos of the vegetables were on their lunch trays, according to a news release from the Hockessin, Del.-based Produce for Better Health Foundation.</p>
<p>The study found that putting the photos on lunch trays increased the amount of green beans consumed from 1.2 grams to 2.8 grams. An even bigger increase was noted for carrots, according to the study, with a jump from 3.6 grams to 10 grams.</p>
<p>What�s more, the study found that more children took green beans at lunch because of the photos, from 6.3% to 14.8%; the number of students taking carrots rose from 11.6% to 36.8%.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Carrots help fight prostrate cancer (April 2013)-</b> CARROTS are latest weapon in the war against prostate cancer, according to groundbreaking new research published by scientists in York (UK). Professor Norman Maitland and his team at the University of York say a diet rich in vitamin A could be the key to beating prostate cancer because it makes the disease far more treatable. The researchers have discovered that retenoic acid, a chemical made from vitamin A, can reduce the ability of the cancer to invade surrounding tissue. Prof Maitland said: �If the cancer is confined to the prostate it�s much much more treatable with conventional medicine. This is about prevention rather than cure but it can stop the spread of the cancer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; �We have found that specific twin genes are turned off in malignant prostate cancer stem cells. When we turn them back on using retinoic acid, the cancer becomes less aggressive.� He said: �It has been known for many years that low vitamin A in samples of men�s blood is associated with prostate cancer, but nobody knew the mechanisms involved. This is an exciting new development which links an element from our diet to prostate cancer stem cells. �Vitamin A can be found in foods such as carrots, sweet potatoes and leafy green vegetables such as kale. Products produced from liver, such as pat�, are also high in vitamin A.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The latest research published by the team in the Yorkshire Cancer Research Unit, is the second recent breakthrough in understanding prostate cancer. The researchers also gained international recognition in 2005 when they became the first to identify prostate cancer stem cells, believed to be the root cause of prostate cancer. More than 10,000 men die annually in the UK from prostate cancer, and almost 41,000 men are diagnosed with the disease each year.</p>
<p><b>Jam of coloured carrots: method to preserve quality of raw material</b></p>
<p>A paper published in the international journal "LWT - Food Science and Technology" shows how to preserve the nutritional properties of carrots using jam.</p>
<p>Carrots, especially the purple ones, can be considered a healthy food due to their high content of phytochemical compounds. However, for some pigmented carrots with interesting sensory characteristics, the higher respiratory activity than common orange carrots reduces shelf-life.</p>
<p>Therefore, the seasonality and the<img border="0" src="photos/jampreserves1.jpg" width="550" height="402" align="right" alt="colored jam preserves carrot" hspace="5" vspace="5" /> perishability of the vegetable, suggest the application of a food technology in order to obtain a more stable product over time. Among the possible processing methods, the jam making is a good alternative. In fact, according to the EC Directive 113/2001, the carrots are considered fruits, so they can be processed and marketed as "jam".</p>
<p>Note how the color of jams obtained by the mild method is more similar to the color of raw carrots than jams from common method. This aspect is particularly evident for the purple carrots: the "mild" method preserves the bright color of the raw material, while the common method causes jam browning due to the long cooking time.</p>
<p>Researchers from the Institute of Sciences of Food Production - National Research Council of Bari (Italy) and the Department of Agricultural and Environmental Science - University of Bari "Aldo Moro" (Italy) have developed a method to obtain jams from the coloured carrots, preserving the sensorial and nutritional characteristics of the raw samples.</p>
<p>In the experiment, two different jam making methods, which differed essentially for cooking times, were compared. In one case (common method) the carrot is subjected to a preliminary pre-cooking for obtaining the puree, before the final cooking. Alternatively, the innovative method ("mild") developed by the researchers consists essentially of the preparation of an uncooked puree, followed by 5 minutes of total cooking.</p>
<p>The research showed that, jams obtained by the mild method were better appreciated, especially the purple type, from the sensory point of view. In addition, this "mild" method preserved the color, antioxidant activity and total phenols content of jams at values similar to the raw material.</p>
