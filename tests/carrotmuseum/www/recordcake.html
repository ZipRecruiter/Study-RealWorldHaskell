<p>The Guildford Town Centre (British Columbia, Canada) marked its 50th anniversary on 8 November 2016 with a whopping carrot cake, measuring six metres by six metres by 10 centimetres high. The giant carrot confection was prepared by the bakers at the Saint Germain Bakery who created the first Guinness World Record for world's largest carrot cake. Mickey Zhao, co-owner of the bakery, said 10 staff had been working every day for long hours since October 30.</p>

<p>�The cake was big enough for 23,000 people,� he said. Zhao said he donated the food and labour costs � an estimated $20,000 to $25,000. �If we sold this cake to a customer, it�d be for $100,000 or more,� Zhao said. �The recognition for it will be nice.�</p>
<p>The first 1,000 people at the event were given a chance to win �karats� in the form of a $1,000 shopping spree at one of the mall�s jewellery stores.</p>
<p>A third of the cake, measuring 20 feet by 20 feet, will be donated to NightShift Street Ministries, a Surrey-based charity, Way added.</p>
<p>The batter used 500 kilograms of carrots, 4,300 eggs, 500 kilograms of sugar and 625 kilograms of flour. The carrots were mixed with pineapple in the bakery to preserve moisture, as the batter was batch mixed. Carrot cake was chosen for its ability to preserve well in room temperature. The cake was baked individually in pans - 600 times - and then transported to the Guildford Town Centre where it was assembled. The assembly of the cake took place over a three-day period between Sunday, November 6 and Tuesday, November 8.</p>
<p>Guildford Town Centre announced that they had donated a large portion of the World Record setting cake to NightShift Street Ministries, and would also be donating $50,000 to the Surrey Fire Fighters' Charitable Society.</p>
