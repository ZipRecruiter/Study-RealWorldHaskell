<br />
All you need is 4 ounces of carrot juice, 10 ounces Palm Oil, 4 ounces Coconut Oil, 2 ounces Olive Oil, 2 ounces lye, 4 ounces water. (Lye is water alkanised for use in washing ñ available at chemists)<br />
<br />
Mix the lye and water and set aside to cool. Melt the oils together, set aside to cool. Once cooled gently pour lye into oils. Add juice to mixture, stirring constantly. Mix until soap traces, pour into prepared moulds, allow to stand covered for 48 hours. Remove from moulds, cut as needed, and allow to age open to the air for 3 weeks.<br />

<br />
Carrots make a lovely drop of wine. Follow the simple instructions.<br />
The hardest part is the wait!<br />
<br /></font> <font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>Ingredients:</b></font> <font face="Arial"><br />
<br />
4 � lbs carrots; 2 � lbs sugar; 1 gallon water; 1lb raisins (chopped)<br />
<br />
2 oranges; 2 lemons; 1 sachet yeast nutrient; 1 tsp yeast; 1 tsp tannin;<br />
1 campden tablet.<br /></font> <font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><img src="gifs/wine2.gif" width="142" height="133" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></font><font face="Arial"><br /></font> <font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>Method:</b></font> <font face="Arial"><br />
<br />
Scrub the carrots and place in a pan of boiling water and simmer until the carrots are soft. Strain the liquid onto the sugar, raisins and the grated rinds of the oranges and lemons. Leave to cool.</font> <font face="Arial"><br />
<br />
Add the tannin, yeast and nutrient. Leave to ferment for six days in the tub. Strain into the demi-john insert air lock and leave in a warm place for six days until the SG is 1.000. Rack into a clean demi-john add the campden tablet and leave for a year.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Carrot Wine Recipe 2</font> <font face="Arial"><br />
Carrot Wine - a delicious 'orange' wine (somehow, the colour paradigm used for the one dimensional grape only wines doesn't seem to lend itself to more sophisticated and versatile wines).<br />
Ingredients:<br />
� 4 lb Carrots<br />
� 2 ounces Fresh Root Ginger<br />
� 4 lb Demerara Sugar<br />
� Juice of 2 Lemons<br />
� Juice of 2 Oranges<br />
� Yeast (use bread yeast - chromatographic testing shows that it gives cleaner results)<br />
� 1 gallon Water<br />
Method:<br />
Grate the carrots and the ginger and put into a very large saucepan (see next if you haven't got such a thing). Pour the water over the shredded carrot and ginger and then boil for around 20 minutes. Finally, strain into a clean bucket.<br />
If you haven't got a large saucepan, divide the carrot and ginger up proportionately between two saucepans and add boiling water. Boil for 20 minutes and strain into a bucket and then repeat the process with more water until you have around a gallon of liquid that has been boiled with the carrot and ginger.<br />
Add the demerara sugar and the lemon and orange juice while still hot and stir until dissolved. Allow to cool to blood temperature and then add the yeast.<br />
Allow to ferment for a day and then transfer to demijohns and continue to ferment until the reaction comes to a halt (2 - 3 weeks). Add two campden tablets and allow the yeast to settle. When clear, filter into bottles and allow 3 months to mature.<br />
Variations:<br />
Try different citrus varieties or types of sugar.<br />
<font color="#FF0000">Storage:</font> Keep in bottles on their side for at least three months.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF0000">Carrot Wine - Recipe 3</font><br />
1.8kg carrots, washed and sliced<br />
900g sugar<br />
340g sultanas<br />
5-6 litres of water<br />
Juice of 2 lemons<br />
Wine yeast<br />
Scrub carrots and cut into pieces. Put into a large saucepan with water and boil until carrots are tender.<br />
Strain off liquid into a large plastic bucket. Remove carrots, transfer liquid back into pan.<br />
Stir in the sultanas and lemon juice.<br />
When the liquid is lukewarm, add the yeast. Cover and leave for seven days, stirring twice daily. Using a fine sieve, strain the liquid into a large container, or demijohn, using an airlock to seal the jar.<br />
Store in warm place and allow the fermentation to work. When fermentation has ceased, rack the wine into a clean jar and place in a cooler environment and leave for a few months.<br />
When the wine is clear and stable (six months) siphon into bottles</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1. Make yourself a carrot template. You want a pie shaped piece. The angle of this triangle is about 45 deg. The sides are 9 inches long and the top is 7 inches across. . You want to make sure that the top side is curved like a pie piece though.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. Lay your template over the cloth and cut around the edge.</p>

<br />
Once you've strung enough carrots, tie the ends together to form a necklace. Lay it on paper in a dark place with ventilation, making sure the slices don't touch each other. As they dry, they turn into wrinkled beads. Drying takes about a week.<br />

<br />
This recipe was first published in a column by Noel Whitcomb in the London Daily Mirror in the 1940's. He called it "whiskey" not because of a whiskey taste, although wheat wines can taste like whiskey, but because of the richness in taste and colour. It is important to stress that the <i>"whiskey"</i> must age for a year before uncorking.<br />
<br /></font> <b><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Ingredients</font></b> <font face="Arial"><br />
<br />
6 lbs carrots;4 lbs finely granulated sugar; 1 lb wheat; 1 tblsp chopped raisins; 2 oranges 2 lemons; 7 pts water; wine yeast.<br />
<br /></font> <font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">Method</font> <font face="Arial"><br />
<br />
Scrub but do not peel the carrots. place them in 7 pints of water and bring to boil, simmering gently until tender (about 25-30 minutes). Meanwhile, put half the sugar in primary. Slice the oranges and lemons into thin slices and arrange on top of the sugar. When the carrots are done, strain them, pouring the water over the sugar and citrus. Stir to dissolve sugar and allow to cool to lukewarm. Add chopped raisins and wheat and sprinkle wine yeast over top. Cover with sterile cloth and set aside, stirring daily. After 6 days add remainder of sugar and stir well to dissolve. Ferment for an additional 8 days, stirring daily. Strain liquid into secondary container and fit airlock. Rack after 30 days and again 30 days later. Bottle and taste after 1 year.</font></p>

<br />
You can make rattlesnake weed brew from the roots of the wild carrot. This is prepared by drying, grinding, and then roasting a few Daucus (wild carrot) roots. Add hot water to a palm full of the roasted roots and let it steep for about 15 minutes before drinking. Delicious!</font></p>

<p align="left"><b>Method</b>: Make a cut across the carrot to create a flat end to drill into. Carefully drill a hole through the carrot lengthways. Check you can sing or talk down the carrot. If you can�t, the hole is probably blocked or not big enough. Drill another large hole from the side of the carrot into the centre of the bore. Cover the side hole with greaseproof paper and lightly hold in place with your fingers around the edges.</p>
<center>
<center>
<p align="left">Start singing ... The key to this instrument is to find the frequency the paper wants to rattle at, so experiment with singing at different pitches. You might need to fiddle with the paper to get it to work. It should be covering the hole so it gets moved by the air, but not so tightly held that it can�t rattle. You can hold the paper in place with your fingers or elastic bands, but this must not be on top of the hole, otherwise you stop the paper moving.</p>
