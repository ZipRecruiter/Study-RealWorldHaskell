<p>Every now and then the World Carrot Museum comes across a really worthy organisation established to help fellow human beings. One such organisation worthy of a big plug is Food Gatherers.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="photos/foodgath1.jpg" alt="Food Gatherers Ann Arbor MI" width="720" height="397" /><br />
Food Gatherers exists to alleviate hunger and eliminate its causes in our community by: reducing food waste through the rescue and distribution of perishable and non perishable food; coordinating with other hunger relief providers; educating the public about hunger; and developing new food resources. These are at the entrance to Food Gatherers' warehouse in Ann Arbor, MI. The organisation uses the carrot as its symbol because it's nutritious, practical and has deep roots, just as Food Gatherers has deep roots in their community.</p>

They are crazy about carrots! They carrots on their trucks, carrots on the walls, and giant carrots in front of the building. The warehouse is even on a road called "Carrot Way" (it is an actual city road that they named!). &nbsp;And of course it is Number 1 Carrot Way - what else?</p>
<p>The company is clearly smitten with the carrot theme, the reason being is that carrots are very healthy, versatile, long lasting, and good looking. Quite true!</p>
<p>The philosophical contingent is that carrots have deep roots in the soil just like Food Gatherers has deep roots in the community. Every day, they rescue and distribute more than 7 tons of food a day, and that is enough for more than 8,000 meals a day!</p>
<p>Thank you Food Gatherers for sharing your carrot craziness with the Museum. &nbsp;Good luck to you all.</p>
