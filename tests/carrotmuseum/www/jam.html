<p align="left"><b>Carrot jam</b> has always been popular in Middle Eastern cultures, and found in 12th century recipes right up to the modern day. We've even done it in the UK in the past, too � Mrs Beeton included a recipe for carrot jam in her Book Of Household Management of 1861; it also found favour in 1909 in Mrs Rorers Vegetable Cookery Book and re-emerged in World War Two Britain under food rationing. <a href="marmalade.html">(Carrot Marmalade here)</a></p>
<p align="left"><b>Pectin</b> (natural setting agent) According to dietaryfiberfood.com, carrots have the most pectin of all the vegetables. Carrots have 0.8 g of pectin per 100 g serving. Carrots are loaded with a wide variety of vitamins and the pectin they contain can help lower your cholesterol. <a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/367234-list-of-vegetables-high-in-pectin/">https://www.livestrong.com/article/367234-list-of-vegetables-high-in-pectin/</a>&nbsp; This makes carrots eminently suitable for making marmalade and jam set easily.</p>
<p align="justify">Many people view the carrot as an unlikely preserve ingredient, but carrot jam is surprisingly palatable. Like a marmalade, this sweet jam uses carrots to provide extra dimensions of texture and flavour for a fun topping.&nbsp;&nbsp; With a tangy taste, and an orange colour not dissimilar to marmalade, carrot jam would have been an occasional Victorian tea-time treat. <b>&nbsp;</b>Beware it often does not set as well as commercial jam.</p>
<p align="justify">Read Dr Annie Gray's (renowned UK food historian) blog about Carrot Jam in various forms - <a href="https://musingsonfoodhistory.wordpress.com/2015/02/10/carrot-jam-several-ways/">here</a> Modern recipe <a href="#jamrecipe01">here</a>&nbsp; Buy Carrot Honey <a href="https://t.co/P3HGwl4zLr">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Is a Carrot a <a name="veg">Vegetable or Fruit?</a> <img border="0" src="photos/preserve.jpg" width="400" height="258" alt="Carrot Jam, Carrpt Pickle, Carrots in Sugar Syrup" align="right" /></b></p>
<p>For the purposes of the European Union's "Council Directive 2001/113/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and sweetened chestnut pur�e intended for human consumption" carrots can be defined as a fruit as well as a vegetable. <font face="Arial">The Directive, written in the 80s and updated in 2001 describes the parameters required for a product to be labelled as jam or marmalade and from which the UK Jam and Similar Products legislation is based, there is the phrase "for the purposes of this directive, tomatoes, the edible part of rhubarb stalks, <font color="#FF0000">carrots</font>, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins, melons and water melons <font color="#FF0000">are considered to be fruit</font>". This was introduced to pacify the Portuguese who are strongly into Carrot Marmalade and it is quite a delicacy!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Of course carrots are not botanically a fruit as they do not carry the seeds, and the above paragraph in the jam directive does not reclassify them as such, just allows them to be used as fruit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Duerrs, the famous British Jam maker does not use any carrots in their products, although many years ago they did try carrot jam and tomato jam. It is recalled that this was to try out what the products would taste like due to the above mentioned in the jam directive. The unanimous conclusion at the time was that tomato jam was actually very nice but carrot jam was awful!</font></p>
<hr color="#FFA500" size="3" />
<p><font face="Arial"><b>12th Century</b> - An Arab named Ibn al-Awan who was writing in Andalusiia in the early part of the 12th century. During that period the carrot travelled westward into the Mediterranean countries. Ibn al-Awam, in the <i>Kitab al-Filahah</i> - his book on Agriculture is the earliest surviving clear description of the carrot and mentions carrot jam thus:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">"The carrot is a diuretic plant; it augments the appetite and enhances one�s energy; at the same time it brings joy to the heart. What works best for the turnip should also work well for the carrot, such as the cool weather, irrigation with fresh water, the repeated action of the north wind. The carrot does not suffer from the snow; it is even favourable, giving it strength, and encouraging a larger size.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It culminates with carrot food preparations when we eat [carrots] with vinegar, brine, olive oil, and certain vegetables or seed. It can also be a medicinal powder mixed with honey and �dibs� which is a date syrup, and with sugar; one gets in this case a great result which <b><font color="#FF0000">ranks in the class of jams</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The poor also use the carrot in place of bread, that, for them, in a few cases, because it soothes hunger and the silent (little known?) fact, that it provides a healthy and nutritious diet. Lambouschad (contemporary with Plutarch� Boeotia, Greece?) recounts that the people of his country were making bread with carrots. They ground the carrots in dry pieces, added a certain quantity of wheat flour, barley, rice or millet. They completed the plan (process), and obtained a bread of good quality, healthful and nourishing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It can also be eaten with sugary preparations (jams) and salted products; only its flavour was more agreeable with tea first; it was more nutritious and more suitable for the body. There is one species of wild carrot; the latter is rather used in medicine, while the cultivated species is more often used as food than a medicine."</font></p>

<p><b>18th Century - The Shakers</b> arrived in the US in the late 1770's bringing with them their recipes from the old country. Carrot Jam was a favourite:</p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b> - 8 good sized carrots, 1 lemon, 2 oranges, 2 tbs of sugar and 1 pinch of salt. <img border="0" src="photos/shakerjam1.jpg" width="314" height="177" align="right" alt="carrot jam" /></p>
<p><b>Method</b> - In a medium saucepan with heavy bottom cook carrots, drain and mash. Put fruit through a food chopper and add pulp to carrot mash, along with sugar and salt. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently to avoid scorching. When mixture reaches desired thickness, remove from heat. Pour into sterilised glass jars and seal with paraffin.<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From "old Shaker Recipes" Bear Wallow Books.</i></p>
<p>A reader made this comment after trying the Shaker recipe - <i>"The Original Shaker one is a great success. It's fantastic. I do not have a food blender so the consistency is imperfect, but it tastes amazing. I added bay leaves (5) and ginger (10g chopped) to the recipe . It's amazing." Readers Photo</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>19th Century - Standard Victorian Carrot Jam</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Makes 4 half-pint jars; Prep Time: 20 minutes; Cook Time: 30 minutes</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ingredients</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Chopped carrots to fill a 1 litre bowl (Four cups) of chopped carrots. Be sure to chop the carrots up nice and small; this will help bring out the carrots' flavours a lot easier. Three cups sugar; Three sliced lemons</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One teaspoon cinnamon; A half teaspoon cloves</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Method:</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. Add all the ingredients into a saucepan, and simmer slowly at a gentle heat. It is recommended that you stir the ingredients constantly, especially at the earlier stages of the cooking. <img border="0" src="photos/vicjam1.jpg" width="443" height="251" align="right" alt="Victorian Carrot Jam" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. After about 20 minutes, the carrots should eventually begin to soften, and the jam will become thick. To make the jam smooth, put everything in a liquidiser and blend for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Obviously, the Victorians didn't have liquidisers, but the results are far more pleasing using this method.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although the jam can be used immediately, the flavour improves more after a few days.</p>
<p>A reader made this comment after trying this recipe -<i>"Victorian Standard Jam, which curiously seemed to not have any medium (fat or water) at all for the simmering of the carrots. I added some water (probably a bit too much to be honest) and cooked for a longer time ~40 minutes, this much darker jam is tasty but not in the same league as the above (Shaker) jam. Again, lack of a food processor makes the constituency more sandwich filler than jam spread." photo right</i></p>
<p>A modern Herbal, Mrs M Greive - Carrot Jam -</p>
<p>Wash and grate some carrots; boil until reduced to a thick pulp. To 1 Ib. of this pulp add 9 oz. sugar, the juice and grated rind of 2 lemons, and 3 oz. margarine. Boil the mixture well for 45 minutes to 1 hour. The result is a useful and inexpensive jam, which can be made for 6d. to 8d. a lb. (according to the price of the lemons), if all materials have to be bought, and for considerably less by those who have home-grown carrots available.</p>

<p><b>20th Century</b> - A Modern Herbal, first published in 1931, by Mrs. M. Grieve, an English Horticulturist, contains Medicinal, Culinary, Cosmetic and Economic Properties, Cultivation and Folk-Lore of Herbs. Maud Grieve recounted a sturdy recipe for carrot jam �</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Wash and grate some carrots; boil until reduced to a thick pulp. To 1lb of this pulp add 9oz sugar, the juice and grated rind of 2 lemons, and 3oz margarine. Boil the mixture well for 45 minutes to 1 hour. The result is a useful and inexpensive jam, which can be made for 6d to 8d (pre-decimal pence) a pound (according to the price of lemons), if all materials have to be bought, and for considerably less by those who have home grown carrots available.</p>
<hr color="#FFA500" size="3" />
<p><a name="ww2"></a><font color="#FF0000"><b>During World War Two</b></font> commercial jam was rationed, commencing in March 1941. The ration was 450g (1lb) every two months.&nbsp; As jam and marmalade were very much a part of British food culture, the Food Ministry were quick to create a viable alternative - Carrot Jam!</p>
<p>This jam was created by Dr. Carrot, who was a creation of the Ministry of Food during the Second World War. An interesting recipe to try!</p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b> 2 1/2 lb small carrots, peeled and sliced thinly; 2 1/2 lb caster/superfine sugar <img border="0" src="photos/jam2.jpg" width="288" height="288" vspace="5" align="right" alt="royal pack carrot jam" /></p>
<p>Finely grated rind and strained juice of 2 lemons; finely grated rind and strained juice of 1 orange</p>
<p><b>Method</b> - Put the carrots into a large saucepan and add just enough water to cover. - Bring to the boil and cook for 15 - 20 minutes, or until soft.</p>
<p>Strain off and reserve the cooking water. Puree the carrots with 1/4 pint of the reserved cooking water in a food processor.&nbsp; Return to the pan.</p>
<p>Pour a further 1/4 pint of the reserved cooking water into a separate pan and add the sugar. Stir over a low heat until dissolved, brushing down the sides of the pan with hot water to keep it free of sugar crystals.</p>
<p>Add the sugar syrup to the carrot puree and stir in the lemon and orange rinds and juice. Bring to the boil over a low heat, stirring occasionally, and then boil rapidly for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove the pan from the heat and test for a set. - If necessary, boil the jam for a further 5 minutes and test again until setting point is reached. - Pour the jam into sterilised warm jars and cover immediately with waxed paper discs and cellophane covers. - Label when cool and store in a cool, dry airy cupboard.</p>
<p><b>Another variation of WW2 Jam -</b></p>
<p>One litre of grated or chopped carrots 3 cups of sugar a jar of honey 3 sliced lemons</p>
<p>1. Method - Add all the ingredients into a saucepan, and simmer slowly at a gentle heat. It is recommended that you stir the ingredients constantly, especially at the earlier stages of the cooking.</p>
<p>2. After about 20 minutes, the carrots should eventually begin to soften, and the jam will become thick.</p>
<p>3. To test jam is ready, place a spoonful on a chilled saucer, if it wrinkles when you push it, it is ready. 4. Store in jars</p>

<p>Carrot jam is very tasty toast topping. Cook grated carrots with orange and lemon zest, cinnamon sticks and fresh bay leaves to make a sticky and utterly delicious jam that doubles up as a colourful Christmas edible gift. Just make sure to save a jar for yourself</p>
<p><img border="0" src="photos/jam5.jpg" alt="Carrot Jam" align="right" width="386" height="217" />Ready in 1 hour 25 minutes; Cooking time 55 minutes;&nbsp; Prep time 30 minutes; Makes3 small jars (per 15g serving)</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Ingredients</font> - 1kg carrots, peeled; 3 medium lemons, zested and juiced; 1 large orange, zested and juiced ; 850g granulated sugar; 2 cinnamon sticks; 3 fresh bay leaves</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Method</font> -</p>
<p>Coarsely grate the carrot. Place in a large heavy based saucepan with the remaining ingredients and leave overnight.</p>
<p>Add 900ml water and place over a medium heat. Stir gently until all the sugar has dissolved. Raise the heat and bring to the boil. Boil rapidly for 40-50 minutes until the temperature reaches 104�C. You can also test it by dolloping � tsp on a small plate and placing in the freezer for 5 minutes. If the jam leaves a ripple-like wrinkle when it�s pushed, it has reached its setting point.</p>
<p>Leave to cool for 15 minutes, then ladle into 3 small, sterilised jars, leaving the cinnamon sticks and bay leaves in the jam. Cover the jars with a small disk of paper, followed by their lids. Store in a cool, dry place.</p>
