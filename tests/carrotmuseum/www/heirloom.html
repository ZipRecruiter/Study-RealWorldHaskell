<hr />
<p><font face="Arial">The definition and use of the word heirloom to describe plants is fiercely debated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">One school of thought places an age or date point on the cultivars. For instance, one school says the cultivar must be over 100 years old, others 50 years, and others prefer the date of 1945, which marks the end of World War II and roughly the beginning of widespread hybrid use by growers and seed companies. Many gardeners consider 1951 to be the latest year a plant could have originated and still be called an heirloom, since that year marked the widespread introduction of the first hybrid varieties It was in the 1970s that hybrid seeds began to proliferate in the commercial seed trade. Some heirloom varieties are much older; some are apparently pre-historic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Another way of defining heirloom cultivars is to use the definition of the word heirloom in its truest sense. Under this interpretation, a true heirloom is a cultivar that has been nurtured, selected, and handed down from one family member to another for many generations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Additionally, there is another category of cultivars that could be classified as "commercial heirlooms": cultivars that were introduced many generations ago and were of such merit that they have been saved, maintained and handed down � even if the seed company has gone out of business or otherwise dropped the line. Additionally, many old commercial releases have actually been family heirlooms that a seed company obtained and introduced.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Regardless of a person's specific interpretation, most authorities agree that heirlooms, by definition, must be open-pollinated.</font></p>
<hr />
<p><font face="Arial">The last few years have seen a resurgence in interest for older, more unusual types of carrot. It's now possible to buy carrots of all shapes, sizes, and colours if you look a little beyond the usual places. And of course, there's vastly more variety available if you grow them yourself from seed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">However, there's an important point to make: these 'new' carrots are in no way a modern invention or the result of genetic modification gone wild. In most cases they're simply a return to older heritage varieties that have been kept alive by traditional growers and enthusiasts, although there has of course been continued progress through selective breeding along the way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">An heirloom variety (or heritage, the phrase seems to be interchangeable),&nbsp; is an old cultivar of a plant used for food that is grown and maintained by gardeners and farmers, particularly in isolated or ethnic minority communities of the Western world. These were commonly grown during earlier periods in human history, but are not used in modern large-scale agriculture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Heirloom plant species are vegetables, flowers, and fruits grown from seeds that are passed down from generation to generation, says Barbara Richardson, horticulturist with the National Gardening Association. Heirloom seeds are open-pollinated, meaning they rely on natural pollination from insects or the wind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Hybrid seeds are created by crossing two selected varieties, sometimes resulting in vigorous plants that yield more than heirlooms. Heirloom vegetables are old-time varieties, open-pollinated instead of hybrid, and saved and handed down through multiple generations of families. More information on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heirloom_plant">Wikipedia here</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Why choose Heirloom/Heritage Carrots?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Many heirloom vegetables have been saved for decades and even centuries because they are the best performers in home and market gardens. Storage or ability to transport wasn�t a concern so flavour ruled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Many gardeners prefer heirloom vegetables because they are open-pollinated, which means you can save your own seed to replant from year to year.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Seeds saved from heirloom vegetables will produce plants that are true to type, unlike hybrid seeds. If you try to save seed from hybrids, you usually won�t get good results,� says Andrew Kaiser, manager at Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Also, with heirloom vegetables you can choose what works best in your garden. If you save seeds from heirloom vegetables over several years, you can gradually select seeds from the plants that perform best in your local soil and climate. This will give you a seed strain that is more resistant to local pests and diseases. Plants are much more adaptable than most of us realize.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Another advantage of heirloom vegetables is that they are �less uniform� than hybrids, which means they often don�t ripen all at once.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Commercial growers love the uniformity of hybrids because they can pick the crop in one fell swoop. But for home gardeners, a gradual supply of fresh produce is usually preferable to the glut of the all-at-once harvest that many hybrids provide.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Many heirlooms have wonderful histories of how they came to the nation where they are now grown. In many cases, these heirloom vegetables have been grown for many centuries all around the world. What a great feeling to be connected through tiny, magical seeds to so many other gardeners from so long ago!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Flavour is not necessarily high on the attributes which modern breeders seek.&nbsp; Modern Hybrid breeders aim to derive cultivars with early maturation, high yield, high beta-carotene content; the ability to set seeds under poor conditions; uniform root size, shape and colour; small tops, tender roots; improved flavour, texture, sugar content and dry matter; resistance to cracking and breaking during harvest, roots that taper uniformly, slowness to bolt; tolerance of poor soil and climate; wide adaptability; resistance to disease, especially leaf blight, black rot, powdery mildew, bacterial soft rot, and and to pests including caterpillars and carrot fly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Important Note</b> - The chemical constituents of carrot are not there by chance, but perform a function. Many constituents of the orange carrot we now cultivate are also in the white root of the wild carrot, Queen Anne's lace, from which our carrot was developed. This is true of falcarinol, falcarindiol, and myristicin. Carotene (present in small amounts in Queen Anne's lace) has been increased by centuries of selection. Volatile oils have been decreased in this process. Plant scientists must continue to monitor all known constituents nutritive and non-nutritive - as new cultivars of the carrot are developed to keep our vegetables nutritious and safe. Plant breeding for the sake of high yields, appearance, and keeping quality will not be sufficient.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A note about "modern" carrots - Heirloom/Heritage carrots show their ancient heritage because they do not have root shear. Root shear is a trait that has been bred into modern carrots that allows the side roots to break off on harvesting, only leaving little eye scars of the skin. This makes for an easy to harvest and process carrot.</font></p>

<p><b>Carrot - Afghan Purple</b></p>
<p>Catalogue Entry <img border="0" src="heritageseed/Afghan%20Purplesm.jpg" alt="afghan purple carrot" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="195" height="238" /></p>
<p>Egyptian cave paintings dating back to around 2000BC show what some think are purple carrots, the orange varieties we are familiar with today were not developed until the 16th century. <i>(no documentary evidence for this)</i> Donated by P Carry of the Southern Exposure Seed Exchange this purple carrot produces 20-25cm roots that do have some tendency to fork. When sliced the purple carrots reveal a bright yellow core, which is maintained when cooked, and have a more pronounced 'carroty' flavour than orange varieties. Shows some resistance to root fly attack.</p>
<p>References</p>
<p>Colour is retained in light cooking. Roots are 9� long, narrowly tapering from a �-1� crown. Best treated as a distinct vegetable, it has a wild carrot flavour, high in terpenoids and low in sugars. Not as sweet or crunchy as garden carrots, it is used as an accent vegetable, especially in salads, where the bi-coloured cross sections add a distinctive flavour and colour. Also great for country fairs. Southern Exposure Seed Exchange</p>
<p>See also: Seed Savers Exchange. Garden seed inventory, 5th ed., p.159. 65 days. Bicoloured roots have yellow core surrounded by purple, 9� long, pleasant wild carrot flavour, texture is similar to celeriac or turnip root, not as sweet or as crunchy as garden carrots.</p>
<p>The carrot is to return to its roots and will go on sale this summer in its original colour � purple. Generations of people in the West have grown up believing that carrots are always orange. But as long ago as 2000BC temple drawings from Egypt show a plant believed to be a purple carrot. It is also identified in the garden of the Egyptian King Merodach-Baladan in 8th century BC. In Roman times carrots were purple or white. By the 10th century purple carrots were grown in Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern Iran. Purple, white and yellow carrots were imported to southern Europe in the 14th century. Black, red and green carrots were also grown but carrots have been orange in the West since Dutch growers decided in the 16th century that the patriotic colour was preferable. Experts believe Dutch breeders used a yellow mutant seed from North Africa to develop the orange variety and then stuck to it through breeding. Their colour comes from beta-carotene with some alpha carotene, a pigment the body converts to vitamin A, which is essential for healthy skin and vision in dim light. Dutch breeders recently studied the health qualities of purple carrots and believe they give us extra protection against various forms of cancer and heart disease. They contain purple pigments called anthocyanins, and acts anti-oxidants that protect the body. Supermarket buyers were keen to try out purple carrots. After pink tomatoes and green tomato ketchup they believe British consumers are keen to experiment. Carrots are the second most popular vegetable after the potato. The first commercial crop is now growing near Ely, Cambridgeshire, and dark purple carrots with orange insides will be sold in Sainsbury�s stores in July. They will brighten up the nation�s dinner plates served as a violet puree, with its classic partner, the green pea, or in a salad. Mark Spurdens, technical manager for Isleham Fresh Produce, said yesterday: �We have had tastings and besides being healthy we think they are sweeter. They also look stunning sliced raw. We are already planning to sell rainbow bunches of carrots next year.� 16 May 2002. www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-297918,00.html</p>

<p>This carrot does not have a hard core. It cooks well and retains its colour. It can be eaten at any stage between baby size and full maturity. I first grew this carrot 40 years ago, obtaining the seed from Carter�s. I regularly produced carrots of 12 to 16 oz. and tender throughout. J. C. Churchill, BA3 6SX</p>
<p>I found these carrots best when eaten young, but those stored for seed stored very well. When removed for replanting, they were still firm. If I had had enough stored for eating, they would have still been as good as the fresh ones. Not a dark carrot in colour, not a lot of core, good flavour and worth growing. P. Howlett, RH11 9AW</p>

<p>Renowned as the best cultivated white carrot, originally introduced in the 1800s for stock feed but is delicious enough for table use. Reported by Alan and Jackie Gear to have a "well developed flavour that is mild and crisp, equal to any orange carrot". Produces pure white roots with green shoulders that show above ground. High yielding and carrot fly resistant. Good for those who cannot tolerate carotene. Mentioned by Vilmorin (1885) and listed in Sutton's catalogue of 1852.</p>

<p>Although there is little or nothing by way of documentary evidence, the mild tasting White Belgium or Belgian White (known in France as Blanche) may well have come from Flanders, and has many similarities to an old variety known in 17th century Britain as Long White. White carrots were grown long before orange carrots burst on to the scene, and of the few white carrots that survive in cultivation, White Belgium is reckoned to have the best flavour. A good cropper, even on lower quality soils (though it abhors frost), it makes a novel addition to salad, soups or stews, and would be worth experimenting with for an albino version of a carrot cake. In France it is most esteemed as horse fodder! Christopher Stocks 2008 Forgotten Fruits A Guide to Britain's Traditional Fruit &amp; Vegetables.</p>
<p>White Belgium, Green-Top White. Root very long, fusiform, frequently measuring 18-20� in length, and 4�-5� in diameter. In the genuine variety, the crown rises 5�-6� from the surface of the ground, and, the exception of a slight contraction towards the top, the full diameter is retained for nearly � the entire length. Skin green above, white below ground. Flesh white, tending to citron yellow at the centre or heart of the root; somewhat coarse in texture. Foliage rather large and vigorous. Remarkable for its productiveness, surpassing in this respect all other varieties, and exceeding that of the Long Orange by nearly �. It can be harvested with great facility, and gives a good return even on poor soils. The variety is not considered of any value as a table esculent, and is grown almost exclusively for feeding stock; for which purpose it is, however, esteemed less valuable than the yellow fleshed sorts, because less nutritious and more liable to decay during winter. Since its introduction it has somewhat deteriorated; and as now grown differs to some extent from the description given above. The roots are smaller, seldom rise more than 2�-3� above the soil, and taper directly from the crown to the point. A judicious selection of roots for seed, continued for a few seasons, would undoubtedly restore the variety to its primitive form and dimensions. Fearing Burr: Field and garden vegetables of America, 1865, p.28</p>
<p>Root sunk in the ground for 2/3rds or � of its length, green or bronze purple on the part over ground; flesh of the root white, with a marked tendency towards a more or less decided yellow tinge. It yields a heavy crop, and in this respect rivals the beetroot. This variety appears to have sprung from the old Long White Carrot, but has now almost entirely gone out of cultivation. Numerous attempts have been made to render it more hardy, so as to have the crop come in at the latter end of autumn without running the risk of having it injured by frost. These attempts have not been successful. The leaves of the plant will bear 4 or 5 degrees of frost, but this is sufficient to produce a change in the tissue of the roots, even in the over ground part, which has been inured to variations of temperature. The underground portion of the root is very sensitive to cold, and becomes disorganized by the slightest frost. It is therefore necessary, when these carrots happen to be pulled in frosty weather, to protect them at once, by covering them with straw or earth, or with their own leaves cut and heaped over them.

<p>White Belgium, 1600s.

White carrots were grown long before orange carrots burst on to the scene, and of the few white carrots to survive in cultivation, White Belgium is reckoned to have the best flavour. A good cropper, even on lower quality soils (though it abhors frost), it makes a novel addition to salads, soups or stews, and would be worth experimenting with for an albino version of carrot cake. In France it is most esteemed as horse fodder. Christopher Stocks: Forgotten fruits: a guide to Britain�s traditional fruit and vegetables. Random House, 2008</p>
