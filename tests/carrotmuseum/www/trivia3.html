<p>"The fift a Physition, on his head a Hat with a bunch of Carrots, a Capon perched upon his fist." is from "The Trivmph of Peace. A Masque, presented by the Foure Honourable Houses, or Innes of Court. Before the King and Queenes Majesties, in the Banquetting-house at White Hall, February the third, 1633. Invented and written, By James Shirley, of Grayes Inne" who was one of the leading playwrights in the decade before the closing of the theatres by Parliament in 1642. <i>(Text is here: http://jacklynch.net/Texts/triumph.html)</i> in which we find:</p>

<p>These pageants or triumphs have, like their predecessors, the mysteries, their relation to the English drama; not only were they composed for the purpose of flattering and complimenting their princes, but a moral end was constantly kept in view: virtue was applauded, while vice was set forth in its most revolting and unpleasing colours; and the altercations between these two leading personages often afforded the populace the highest amusement.</p>
<p>The opportunity was also seized upon of presenting to royal ears some of the political abuses of the day; as in one offered by the Inns of Court to Charles the First, where ridicule was thrown upon the vexatious law of patents: a fellow appearing with a bunch of <b>carrots</b> on his head, and a capon on his fist, and asking for a patent of monopoly as the first inventor of the art of feeding capons with carrots, and that none but himself should have privilege of the said invention for fourteen years; whilst another came mounted on a little horse with an immense bit in his mouth, and the request that none should be allowed to ride unless they purchased his bits.</p>

The leaves being applied with honey to running sores or ulcers cleanse them; I suppose the seeds of them perform this better than the roots: and though Galen recommended garden carrots highly to expel wind, yet they breed it first, and we may thank nature for expelling it, not they; for the seeds of them expel wind and so mend what the root marreth."</p>

<p><b>Grimm�s Fairy Tale No. 146 The Carrot King</b></p>
<p>Once there lived two brothers, both serving as soldiers. One brother was rich, the other poor. The poor one, seeking to alleviate his dire need, took off his soldier�s uniform and became a farmer. Now he spent his time digging, hoeing and hacking his little acre and sowed a row of carrots. The seed sprouted and a carrot soon grew that was so large and strong and noticeably thicker than the others. In fact, it would not stop growing. One could even say it was the Crown Prince or Ruler of all Carrots because never again has there been such a carrot (nor, I suspect, shall there ever be another one like it). Finally it was so big that it filled up an entire wagon and two oxen were required to pull it. The farmer did not know what to do with the thing, and he wondered whether the carrot was his fortune or misfortune. Finally he thought to himself �If you sell it, what great reward will you fetch? And the smaller carrots are just as good for eating. It is best that you present it to the king and honor him with the gift.�</p>
<p>So he loaded the carrot on his wagon, hitched up two oxen and drove to court to present the carrot to the king. �What kind of strange thing have you brought?� the king asked. �I have seen many odd things in my day, but never such a monster. From what type of seed could this have grown? Or perhaps, the vegetable has only grown this way for you because you are a child of fortune.�</p>
<p>�Oh no,� the farmer replied. �I am no fortune�s child. I am a poor soldier who could no longer feed himself. So I hung my soldier�s uniform on a nail and now tend the soil. I have a brother who is rich, whom you certainly know. But I have nothing and have been forgotten by the world.�</p>
<p>The king felt compassion for him and said �You shall overcome your poverty and will receive presents from me so that you shall be the equal of your rich brother.�</p>
<p>The king gave him enormous amounts of gold, farmland, fields and cattle and made him stone-rich, so that the riches of his brother did not compare. When his brother heard what had been accomplished with a single carrot, he was overcome with jealously and plotted how he, too, could secure such fortune for himself. But he wanted to do it in a much smarter way so he took gold and horses and brought them to the king. He thought the king would give him much greater riches in return, because his brother had received so much for a single carrot. The king received the brother�s gift and said, he did not know what to give him in return that could be rarer or better than the large carrot. So the rich brother had to accept his brother�s carrot as present from the king. He put it in his wagon and drove home. At home he did not know on whom he could take out his rage and anger until finally an evil thought came to him. He decided to kill his brother and so he hired murderers, who were instructed to lay in waiting. He now went to his brother and said �Dear brother, I know a secret treasure. Let us go out together, unearth it and share it.�</p>
<p>The brother let himself be convinced and innocently went along. But when they were walking, the murderers fell upon him, tied him up and wanted to hang him on a tree. They were just about to carry out the evil deed when the sound of song and the beating of hooves could be heard in the distance. Such a terror seized them, that in their haste they pushed their prisoner into a sack, hung it on a tree and took flight. But the prisoner worked nimbly with his fingers until there was a hole in the sack, through which he could stick his head. But who should be the next one to come down the path but a wandering student, a young fellow who rode through the forest singing loudly. When the one hanging in the sack noticed that someone was passing below he called out �Greetings to you in this fine hour.�</p>
<p>The student looked all around and did not know from where the voice came. Finally he said �Who is calling me?� From the treetop the prisoner now called �Raise your eyes. I am sitting up here in the sack of wisdom. In only a short amount of time I have learned many things, among them that all learning is as elusive as the wind. Soon I will have mastered everything, will come down and be wiser than all humankind. I understand the stars and can read the signs of the heavens, can decipher the blowing of the winds, the sand in the sea, know all manner of healing sickness, recognize the powers of herbs, birds and stones. If you sat here in my place, you too would soon understand the wonder that flows out of my sack of wisdom.�</p>
<p>When the student heard all this he was amazed and said �Blessed be the hour when I found you. Couldn�t I too sit a while in the sack?� From above the prisoner replied as if he did not relish the idea. �I will let you sit here for a very short time in return for a reward and good words. But you must wait another hour; I still have to learn a bit more.�</p>
<p>When the student had waited a bit, he began to be restless. The time seemed too long and he begged immediate entry to the sack; his thirst for wisdom was far too great to wait any longer. The prisoner in the sack pretended he had finally given in and said �So that I can emerge from this cocoon of wisdom, you must lower the sack by that rope tied to the tree. Then you can crawl inside.�</p>
<p>The student lowered the sack, opened it and freed the man inside. Then he called out eagerly �Now pull me up into the tree quickly!� He wanted to walk into the sack standing upright. �Stop!� cried out the other. �That won�t do at all!� He grabbed him by the head and pushed him in backwards, tied the opening around his head and pulled the disciple of wisdom up into the tree, where he swayed back and forth in the air. �How do you fare up there my dear fellow? See, don�t you already feel wisdom dawning with experience? Now sit quietly until you become much smarter than you already are.�</p>
<p>And so he mounted the student�s horse, rode away and after an hour sent out someone to let the fellow out of the tree.</p>

I breathe in gasps and not sighs,<br />
I drift away from reality from all the crys and screams,<br />
I understand that all this pain god necessary deems,<br />
I come to a minds-eye field of Queen Annes lace,<br />
I run across embodied by youthful grace.<br />
I fall into deaths sweet embrace,<br />
and somewhere far from here an white haired woman<br />
forever sleeps, an free smile on her face.</font></td>

Today I think<br />
Only with scents, - scents dead leaves yield,<br />
And bracken, and wild carrot's seed,<br />
An the square mustard field;<br />
Odours that rise<br />
When the spade wounds the root of tree,<br />
Rose, currant, raspberry, or goutweed,<br />
Rhubarb or celery.<br />

Oh the carrots that bloom in the spring time<br />
I'd rather have carrots than fish<br />
Or pheasants or fowl or even an owl<br />
In fact they are my favorite dish</font></font></small></small><font face="Arial">.</font></td>

I never guessed there were volcanoes in Illinois,<br />
until I found them in my own garden.<br />
Now, it happens every fall,<br />
when I�m led to tall crater tops<br />
issuing feathery green smoke.<br />
<br />
I dig around gently in pitch-black earth<br />
and touch something just beneath the surface,<br />
where emerges the orange-hot lava of carrots<br />
urged out in thick, hearty bunches.<br />
I always make sure to wear gloves.<br />
<br />
It�s rumoured carrots are good for the eyes,<br />
yet who can�t help but see their radiance<br />
when garden work is done<br />
and twilight duskiness rises<br />
like a dark mountain.<br />
<br />
No matter how cold and crisp to the touch,<br />
the carrots glow<br />
like candles in my basket,<br />
as they lead me up the<br />
backstairs of my house.</font></span></td>
<td width="50%" valign="top"><br />
I wash away a layer of mud and<br />
pretend the carrots have been waiting all summer<br />
to be released from their ebony underworld,<br />
from their earthly wrap,<br />
to their full expression on my brazen stove.<br />
<br />
I slice each root,<br />
carrot circles wink approval,<br />
and the steamer collects a cache<br />
which I cook and am paid<br />
in richly colored coins to do so.<br />
<br />
After dinner, I toss one from my plate<br />
back into the earth for good luck.<br />
Soon, the curling autumn fog rolls in, followed by winter snows,<br />
cooling this upheaval of golden abundance<br />
in layers of chalky ash.<br />
