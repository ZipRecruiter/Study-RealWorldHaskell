<a name="200"><!-- --></a><a href="manuscripts.html">This separate page</a> in the Carrot museum takes a detailed look at how carrots were illustrated in some of the famous Materia Medica Manuscripts and Early Printed Books, mainly produced in this era of carrot history (ad 200-1500). <i>&nbsp;Read about some of the significant references in <a target="_blank" href="herbalists.html">Ancient Herbals here</a>.<br /></i><br />
<font color="#FF0000"><b>NEWS</b></font> - The World Carrot Museum has the honour of having an article published in the renowned academic journal Chronica Horticulturae.&nbsp; Co-authored with Jules Janick, the James Troop Distinguished Professor in Horticulture, Department of Horticulture &amp; Landscape Architecture, Purdue University.&nbsp;&nbsp; The item is called <b>Carrot History and Iconography,</b> a fascinating journey through the Carrot's development from Wild to Domesticated Orange and beyond.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.actahort.org/chronica/pdf/ch5102.pdf">Full copy here</a> (page 13 onwards). <a href="../finaljournal.pdf">Extract here.</a>
<hr />
<p><font color="#FF0000">The name Carota</font> for the garden Carrot is found first in the writings of Athenaeus (A.D. 200), and in the book on cookery by Apicius Czclius.&nbsp; The Athenaeus work called "The Deipnosophistae" (Book IX (Part 1 of 5) , which means "dinner-table philosophers recorded that <i>Diphilus said of the carrot "This is pungent, very nourishing and fairly wholesome, with a tendency to loosening and windiness; not easy to digest, very diuretic, calculated to rouse sexual desire; hence by some it is called love-philtre."</i> Athenaeus also notes that <i>"Staphulinos (carrot) is called astaphilinus by Diocles in the first books of 'Matters on Health'. The so-called karaton (which is big and quickly growing carrots) is more tasty than the staphulinos and more heating, more diuretic, easily digested and wholesome"</i></p>
<p>It was Galen the Greek physician at the court of Marcus Aurelius (second century A.D.) who named the wild carrot Daucus pastinaca&nbsp; (adding the name Daucus) to distinguish the Carrot from the Parsnip, though confusion remained steadfast until botanist Linnaeus set the record straight in the 18th century with his system of plant classification. The Greeks called the carrot Philon or Philtron from their word philo that means loving. However, the carrot's Latin name Daucus carota most influenced its present name that came from the French who named it carotte.</p>
<p>It is thought that this word comes from the Greek karoton through the Latin carota It has been known since ancient times and is believed to have originated in Afghanistan and adjacent areas. There is also a school of thought which says that it is derived from ancient Greek for a yellow root, slender leaved parsnip, so called because it was thought to impart a pleasant smell "Carum", or from karuon "a sweet taste.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>(Carum is a genus of about 20 species of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, native to temperate regions of the Old World, now known to be carraway.)</i></p>
<p>Galen said that the wild carrot "is less fit to be eaten than the cultivated variety".</p>
<p>The breakdown of the Roman Empire resulted in social disturbances, destruction of the large cities, and a general decline in culture, a period often referred to as the Dark Ages. This is evidenced in the deterioration in the accuracy and content of plant illustrations. Scribes continued to reproduce and embellish previous manuscripts, rather than observing and representing the existing native plants, and a dogmatic scholasticism that stifled original investigation.</p>
<p><b>The early Middle</b><i><a href="photos/dioscorides.jpg"><img border="0" src="photos/dioscoridessm.jpg" align="left" alt="Image of Dioscorides Lombardy manuscript 1400" width="93" height="140" hspace="8" vspace="3" /></a></i> <b>Ages</b> is a murky period in history for the study of vegetables, but a copy of the Codex of Dioskorides dating from 500 to 511 ad is illuminated with pictures of plants. The drawings are fairly accurate and convey the important physical characteristics of the vegetables and herbs shown. Thus it is possible to determine that a carrot shown in folio 312 (below) resembles pretty accurately modern day&nbsp;carrot, and more importantly is the earliest depiction of an orange root! The Codex is medical in nature, dealing with the health and dietary aspects of the plants discussed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Arial">It needs to be stressed that the original Dioscorides manuscript was not illustrated, although it has suggested that some of the illustrations in the 512 codex may have been derived from Krataeus, author of a lost herbal and physician to the King of Pontus, Mithridates VI Eupater, in the 1st century BCE.</span></p>
<p>Krateuas (Crateuas) 120 B.C. was physician in ordinary to Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus (died 63 B.C.). Krateuas described as well as illustrated plants. Some fragments of his writings have been recognized in the Anicia Codex of Dioscorides in the Vienna State Library to which reference has been made below. Krateuas presumably produced the figures in natural colour and they were continuously copied in many manuscripts and printed herbals from the 6th Century on. Krateuas is mentioned by Pliny. <i>&nbsp;(the original copy is maintained in the Austrian Library in Vienna, the scan shown below is from the original)<br /></i> See separate page showing illustrations from <a target="_blank" href="manuscripts.html">ancient manuscripts</a>.</p>

<p>Above&nbsp; - The oldest known manuscript of Dioscorides work is the Juliana Anicia Codex (ca. 512 A.D.), housed in the Austrian National Library in Vienna. Listed as Codex Vindobonensis Medicus Graecus 1., it is better known as �Vienna Dioscorides,� the oldest and most valuable work in the history of botany and pharmacology.</p>
<p>Since an original copy of Dioscorides�s herbal has never been found, we cannot be certain that it included illustrations. It is certain, however, that, in 512 A.D. or a little later,, a Byzantine artist in Constantinople&nbsp; illustrated Dioscorides herbal for presentation to Juliana Anicia, the daughter of Emperor Anicius Olybrius. The artist seems to have based his work on illustrations from the Rhizotomicon of Crateuas of Pergamon (1st century B.C.).&nbsp; This Codex reflects the habit prevailing in the aristocratic classes of ordering products of the hand book type of Literature.&nbsp; Juliana was the daughter of Flavius Anicius Olitrius, Western Emperor in 472.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides</font> &nbsp;catalogued over 600 medicinal plant species and their possible medical uses, during his first century travels as a roman army doctor and who accurately describes the modern carrot. He compiled an extensive listing of medicinal herbs and their virtues in about 70 A.D.&nbsp; Originally written in Greek, Dioscorides' herbal was later translated into Latin as De Materia Medica. It remained the standard reference and authority on medicinal plants for over 1500 years.&nbsp; The third book of Dioscorides the Greek � Roots -&nbsp; sets out an account of roots, juices, herbs, and seeds � suitable both for common use and for medications. <a href="dioscorides.html">(Modern Translations here)</a></p>

<p>It should also be noted that Parsnip is referenced as a separate plant (Pastinaca Sativus) indicating a clear distinction with carrot.</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Throughout the Medieval writings, carrots are confused with parsnips. When Linnaeus created scientific names, he called carrots Daucus carota parsnips Pastinaca sativa, so the two are clearly different. Before Linnaeus, however, Pastinaca sativa was used for both plants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Fuchs in 1542 described red and yellow garden carrots and wild carrots, but names them all Pastinaca (Meyer Trueblood and Heller1999). Gerard (1633) uses the English name carrot, but calls it Pastinaca in Latin: Pastinaca sativa var. tenuifolia, the yellow carrot and Pastinaca sativa atro-rubens, the red carrot. Gerard distinguishes parsnips from carrots and calling the parsnip Pastinaca latifolia sativa and P. latifolia sylvestris.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Gerard notes the name similarity and is dissatisfied with it. He gives daucus as a name for carrot in Galen, but notes that many Roman writers called it pastinaca or other names. I don't think the plants were confused particularly, but since we have in many cases only the written word, if the Medieval writer called his plants "pastinaca", it is impossible to know if they were carrots or parsnips.</font></p>
<p>It is interesting when one reads the what the Herbalists of the 15th century say about carrot and how so many refer to carrot being used for animal bites,&nbsp; urination problems, conception aids and methods of expelling embryos and after birth.&nbsp; Clearly using this source from 1000 years earlier.&nbsp; <a href="herbalists.html">Read about the Herbalists and how they recommended carrots here.</a></p>
<p>Another translation states - Dioscorides wrote "Ye root ye thickness of a finger, a span long, sweet-smelling, edible being sodden [boiled]. Of this ye seed being drank...and it is good for ye [painful discharge of urine] in potions, and for ye bitings and strokes of venomous beasts; they say also, that they which take it before hand shall take no wrong of wilde beasts. It co-operates also to conception, and it also being [diuretic], both provoketh [poison], and being applied; but the leaves being beaten small with honey, and laid on, doth cleanse rapidly spreading destructive ulceration of soft tissues." <i>Source: Mitch, 1998.</i></p>
<p>He recommended the seeds of Wild Carrot for the relief of urinary retention, to stimulate menstruation and to "wake up the genital virtue."&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Anthimus c450-525 ad</b> &nbsp;was a 6th century Byzantine Greek doctor&nbsp; who, while serving as an ambassador to the King of the Franks, wrote a cookery treatise that reflects both Byzantine and Frankish tastes. Anthimus is known in the food history world as author of "De observatione ciborum" ("Observations about food"), written either shortly after 511 AD, or sometime around 526 AD. It was probably the last cookbook to come out of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Anthimus lists, what was perceived at the time, as healthy and unhealthy eating habits and food and underlines the dependence of health on good food and nutrition. Anthimus mentions turnips in one paragraph, noting that they can be boiled in oil and salt or cooked with meat or bacon and flavoured with vinegar. In the next paragraph, he discusses pastinacea which could mean anything in the carrot/parsnip family, and notes that they can be eaten boiled or parboiled and then fried and are good mixed into other dishes.</p>
<p><i>The work is De obseruatione ciborum (On the observance of foods) and the definitive current edition and translation is by Mark Grant. � Grant, Mark ed. 1996. Anthimus: De obseruatione ciborium -- On the observance of foods. Prospect Books, Totnes. ISBN 0907325-750</i></p>

Etymologiae was the most used textbook throughout the Middle Ages. It was so popular that it was read in place of many of the original classical texts that it summarized, so these ceased to be copied and were lost.

<p class="MsoNormal">The Codex Neapolitanus is one of the oldest manuscripts in the tradition of Materia Medica, the leading pharmacological work of Greco-Roman times, written by the Greek surgeon Pedanius Dioscorides in the 1st century A.D. The eminent role of this codex is not least due to the great number of botanical illustrations and descriptions of plants in all their details.<br />
The primary significance of Dioscorides as a major authority in his field is evidenced by the wide spread use of his work over the centuries. In the 6th century it was translated into Latin and from the 9th century, it was transliterated and edited also in Arabic, Syrian and Hebrew. Materia Medica thus remained the pharmacological reference work and was read not only by physicians and botanists but also by interested lay botanists.<br />
The Neapolitan codex can be dated to the early 7th century, although research still ignores whether it was made in Byzantium or in Italy. G. Cavallo suggests that the miniatures in the manuscript were obviously a product of the activity of Greek artists in Italy. The 403 miniatures depict different plants and bear unique testimony to the unmatched virtuosity of the illuminators of this period.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black">There are many surviving manuscripts of De Materia Medica after Codex Vindobonensis, an important example being the seventh-century Greek alphabetic Codex Neapolitanus, in the possession of a Neapolitan monastery for many years, and then presented to Emperor Charles VI in 1717. It was taken to Vienna and subsequently to the Bibliotheca Nazionale in Naples. Some of the drawings in Codex Neapolitanus are thought to be from the same source as Codex Vindobonensis, but are smaller and grouped together on fewer pages.</span></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">The 8th century</font> saw the beginning of a period of rapid Arab expansion. The Arabs were great ones for writing about everything they were finding in, and bringing home from, invaded regions, including the fat, juicy carrots of Afghanistan. Once Arabs discovered the improved carrots, they spread them quickly to trade partners and conquered lands. The crunchy root sped across North Africa and up into Moor-controlled Spain. By the time Ibn al-Awam was writing about carrots in the 12th century, from his home in Andalusia, he not only had several varieties available to him, he had older works to quote from</p>
<p>After the fall of Rome, gardens and vegetables are rarely mentioned again until 795 ad, when King Charlemagne enacted a charter or capitulary entitled "Capitulare de villis vel curtis imperii" or "Capitulare de villis" (Of imperial lands and imperial courts), in chapter 70 of which appears a list of 90 plants and fruit trees recommended to cultivate in the gardens of the Frankish Empire, which covered western and central Europe. Carrots (carvitas) are found in the list of vegetables recommended for cultivation by Charlemagne.&nbsp; Note - Pastinacas (Parsnip) were also shown as a separate plant.</p>
<p>Charlemagne's edict tells his subjects what he expects of them: <img border="0" src="photos/Capitularedevillis.jpg" alt="King Charlemagne Capitulare de villis ad 795 carrot" width="250" height="360" align="right" /></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Charlemagne welcomed new fruits and vegetables into his royal gardens and set aside an area for growing carrots, though their flavour did not win them a great deal of acceptance there either. To lessen their appeal, the purple carrots turned brown when cooked. Worse still, any liquid and foods cooked in the same pot also turned brown.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF0000">In 10th Century</font> &nbsp;carrot consumption is traced to the hill people of Afghanistan (ad 900), who were sun-worshippers and believed that eating orange or yellow coloured foods instilled a sense of righteousness. People also ate yellow and purple conical tap root varieties of carrots in Pakistan. At this time Arab merchants traversing the trade routes of Africa, Arabia, and Asia brought seeds of this purple carrot back home with them. From their villages and cities along the coast of North Africa, Moors brought the carrot up into Spain and to the rest of Europe, probably from Afghanistan. Yellow and purple&nbsp;carrots are first recorded in Asia Minor and the Byzantine Empire (now Turkey) in the <font color="#000000">10th century. This was a mutation which effectively removed the anthocyanins which gives the red/purple colour.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The oldest surviving medical text book in England is also the oldest herbal, for of course herbs were medicine in the middle ages. This is the <b>Leech Book of Bald</b>,(l�ce in Old English means healer) compiled in �lfred's time or very shortly thereafter by a monk named Bald, and penned, in its surviving copy, between 924 and 946 by a scribe (almost certainly also a monk) named Cild and possibly under the influence of Alfred the Great's educational reforms. This work included many references to carrot and remedies for consumption, thick eyelids, smallpox and hiccups. It was also an ingredient of a quieting drink.

<p><b>In around 950</b>, Ibn Sayyār al-Warrāq's produced a cookbook, the most comprehensive work of its kind. This traditional cookbook with more than 600 recipes using medieval ingredients and dishes from the luxurious cuisine of medieval Islam is also a rare guide to the contemporary culinary culture. He described the carrots used in his recipes thus:</p>
<blockquote><i><b>Jazar - carrots. Of the cultivated varieties</b></i>
<p><i>1. Red Carrot (jazar ahmar) literally 'red', described as juicy, tender, and delicious. Poets compare it to carnelian, rubies, flames of fire, and coral reeds.</i></p>
<p><i>2. Yellow Carrot (jazar asfar), thicker and denser in texture than the red.</i></p>
<p><i>3. White Carrot (jazar abyad) similar to parsnips, aromatic, and deliciously sharp in taste. It is also described as having a pleasant crunch.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For more details on the cookbook and the 10th century recipes using carrots, there is a separate page in the Carrot museum. <a href="alwarraq.html">Here.</a></p>
<p>The cultivated carrot is believed to originate from Afghanistan before the 900s, as this area is described as the primary centre of greatest carrot diversity <i>(Mackevic 1929)</i>, Turkey being proposed as a secondary centre of origin <i>(Banga 1963)</i>. The first cultivated carrots exhibited purple or yellow roots. Carrot cultivation spread to Spain in the 1100s via the Middle East and North Africa. In Europe, genetic improvement led to a wide variety of cultivars. White and orange-coloured carrots were first described in Western Europe in the early 1600s <i>(Banga 1963)</i>. Concomitantly, the Asiatic carrot was developed from the Afghan type and a red type appeared in China and India around the 1700s <i>(Laufer 1919; Shinohara 1984)</i>. According to this history, it makes sense to envisage that colour should be considered as a structural factor in carrot germplasm.</p>

<p><b>1025 - The Canon of medicine of Avicenna</b> (980-1037) - The famous medical work of the Medieval Islamic doctor Avicenna -The Canon of Medicine - is an encyclopaedia of medicine in five books compiled by Persian philosopher Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna) and completed in 1025. His most famous works are The Book of Healing, a philosophical and scientific encyclopedia, and The Canon of Medicine, a medical encyclopedia which became a standard medical text at many medieval universities and remained in use as late as 1650.</p>
<p>It presents a clear and organized summary of all the medical knowledge of the time. It is a "magisterial exposition of Galenic medicine", although while Avicenna accepted Galen's evidence on anatomical matters he preferred Aristotle's theories where they differed from Galen. It served as a more concise reference in contrast to Galen's twenty volumes of medical corpus. As part of the Arabic translation project Ibn-Sina drew on various sources in the writing of his Canon an important one being the extensive pathology text from Chinese medicine called the Zhubing Yuanhuo Lun written in about 610 by Chao Yuan-fang. Ibn-Sina also drew on the early Chinese pulse diagnosis classic text the Maijing by Wang Shu-hu which was written in circa 310. Avicenna was a Persian polymath who is regarded as one of the most significant physicians, astronomers, thinkers and writers of the Islamic Golden Age. He has been described as the father of early modern medicine.</p>
<p>Originally written in the Arabic language, the book was later translated into a number of other languages, including Persian, Latin, Chinese, Hebrew, German, French, and English with many commentaries. The Canon is considered one of the most famous books in the history of medicine. Here is the recommended use of carrots:</p>

To determine which it is one employs the indications given in preceding chapters. If palpation of the breasts shows them to be unduly hot, the diet should consist of such things as barley water, spinach, and the like. If there are signs of coldness of temperament in the breasts, and of obstructions, or inadequate attractive power, the diet should include attenuated aliments tending to a warm nature ; and cupping instruments should be applied beneath the breasts, taking care not to press much on the breast. <font color="#FF0000"><b>Carrot seed</b></font> is also beneficial, and the <font color="#FF0000"><b>carrot itself</b></font> is also very good for such a condition.</p>

<p>In About 1086, Ibn al Bassal an Islamic Botanist and scholar who lived in Seville, Spain from wrote a lengthy treatise on agronomy (Diwan al-filaha) �Libro de Agricultura� - The Book on Agriculture, a treatise on agriculture. <img border="0" src="photos/vilmdurtchorn.jpg" alt="Vilmorin 1856 Dutch Horn carrot" width="225" height="282" align="right" vspace="3" /></p>
<p>It is full of information on the cultivation of plants and trees, pharmacological data and many items on botany. Very little is known about his life. However, judging from the meaning of his Arabic name Ibn Bassal (i.e. the Son of the Onion Grower), he seems to be a learned agriculturalist from a farming family.</p>
<p>The book, though not a cookbook per se, contains information about the different kinds of foodstuff and how to produce them and preserve them, in addition to the agricultural methods involved in cultivation, irrigation, pest control and land tilling in Andalusia in the 11th century. The treatise by Ibn Bassal is singular in that it contains no reference to earlier agronomists; it appears to be based exclusively on the personal experiences of the author, who is revealed as the most original and objective of all the Hispano-Arabic specialists.</p>
<p>The treatise was lost for many years until a mediaeval Castilian translation of it was discovered by Prof. Millis in the Cathedral Library of Toledo and extracts of it were published by him in 1942.</p>
<p>Bassal�s ancient text deals with all the fundamentals of horticulture and propagation. In Chapter XIII he deals with Garden plants - Rapes, <b>carrots</b>, radishes, garlic, onions, leeks, parsnip, capsicum (pimento), madder. The interesting feature of it is its character. It is matter of fact, practical, didactic, concise; there is no nonsense in it and no digressions on materia medica, no magic and no astrology.</p>
<p>Here is a grand prescription from the Arabian School of old physicians (based on the universal antidote of <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">King Mithridates:</span></p>
<blockquote><i>One of the most favourite of their preparations, which went by the name of Theriacum, was composed of the following substances: � Squills, hedychroum, cinnamon, common pepper, juice of poppies, dried roses, water-germander, rape seed, Illyrian iris, agaric, liquorice, opobalsam, myrrh, saflFron, ginger, rhaponticum, cinquefoil, calamint, hore- hound, stone-parsley, cassidony, costus, white and long- pepper, dittany, flowers of sweet rush, male frankincense, turpentine, mastich, black cassia, spikenard, flowers of po- ley, storax, parsley seed, seseli, shepherd's pouch, bishop's weed, germander, ground pine, juice of hypocistis, Indian leaf, Celtic nard, spignel, gentian, anise, fennel seed, Lem- nian earth, roasted chalcitis, amomum, sweet flag, balsa- mum. Pontic valerian, St. John's wort, acacia, gum, carda- mom, <b>carrot seed</b>, galbanum, sagapen, bitumen, oposonax, castor, centaury, clematis, Attic honey, and Falernian wine.</i></blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">Sixty-six ingredients composed this mixture, and with the exception of the last, we may safely affirm that the physicians who prescribed it were entirely ignorant of the effects of any one of them, either taken by those in health or given to the sick<i>.</i></font></p>
<p>Another Arab book of agriculture from around 1180 by Ibn al-Awam also lists carrots and many more vegetables in the cultivated plants of Andalusia and suggests that there was a real wave of plant introductions to Spain soon after 1100. More on this Arab writing below - <a href="#arab">here</a>.</p>

<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><a name="arab"></a>In the 12th century</font></b> there was a budy period of Arab expansion into the Middle East, Central Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>Moorish invaders (from Morocco) and then Arabian traders brought seeds of purple and a yellow carrot t<img src="photos/purp1.jpg" width="388" height="254" align="right" vspace="8" alt="purple carrots" hspace="5" />o the Mediterranean via the coast of North Africa, along with spinach and aubergines. They quickly spread across Europe from Spain, into Holland, France and finally England.&nbsp; Many writers state that the carrot, in something like its modern form, was brought westwards, at least as far as the Arab countries of the East Mediterranean, from Afghanistan, where the very dark red, even purple, carrots of antiquity are still grown.</p>
<p>During this period the carrot travelled westward into the Mediterranean countries. Ibn al-Awwam, in the <i>Kitab al-Filahah</i> - his book on Agriculture - citing a much older work (probably Ibn al Bassal an Islamic Botanist mentioned above) - gave a definitive description of two varieties of carrots he encountered in the early part of the 12th century: a red one (probably purple) he says is tasty and juicy and the other, a yellow and green carrot, he calls coarser and of inferior flavour. This is the <b>earliest surviving clear description of the carrot</b> (and colours) dating from the first half of the 12<sup>th</sup> century. <font face="Arial">(Full Spanish text download here - <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=daZEAAAAcAAJ&amp;rdid=book-daZEAAAAcAAJ&amp;rdot=1">Google books free</a>) (<a href="https://archive.org/details/lelivredelagric00algoog/page/n15">French version</a> at archive.org)</font></p>
<p>Ibn al-Awwam (d 1185) was an Arab agriculturist who flourished at Seville in Spain during the 12th century. He wrote a treatise on agriculture in Arabic called <font face="Arial">"Kitab al-Filahah al-Andalusiyah" (The Book of Andalusian Agriculture)</font>, which is the most comprehensive treatment of the subject in medieval Arabic, and one of the most important medieval works on the subject in any language. It was published in Spanish and French translations in the 19th century. The edition in French, is about 1350 pages. Chapter 24 article ll gave instructions and advice on �Sowing and cultivation of root crops, including carrot, turnip, horse-radish, onion, leek, garlic, sekakul, colocasia, and others.� <font face="Arial">(</font><i>See full translation of the&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="Ib-Al-Awanwatermark.pdf">section on carrots here</a>. (pdf) from the French version)</i></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The work comprises 35 chapters dealing with agronomy, cattle and poultry raising, and beekeeping. It deals with 585 plants; explains the cultivation of more than 50 fruit trees; and includes many valuable observations on soils, manures, plant grafting, and plant diseases. This lengthy handbook on agriculture&nbsp; was is the most comprehensive treatment of the subject in medieval Arabic, and one of the most important medieval works on the subject in any language.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">His book is the earliest surviving clear description of the carrot thus: he told of 2 kinds of carrots: the red <i>(vermilion, possibly purple)</i> carrot, already known in Syria in the 4th century and rather sweet, and a larger rooted, but less tasty variety, of a green-yellow colour.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">He mentions that "carrots are usually boiled with turnips, and then eat the two things together in the way we have expressed - boiling them twice and draining the water afterwards, they are infused with vinegar, and olive oil, and throwing in them rough chopped, peppermint, basil or whatever is to hand by hand, eaten with bread. "</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Arial"><br />
<br /></font></blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">He also mentions carrot jam thus:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"The carrot is a diuretic plant; it augments the appetite and enhances one�s energy; at the same time it brings joy to the heart. What works best for the turnip should also work well for the carrot, such as the cool weather, irrigation with fresh water, the repeated action of the north wind. The carrot does not suffer from the snow; it is even favourable, giving it strength, and encouraging a larger size.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>It culminates with carrot food preparations when we eat [carrots] with vinegar, brine, olive oil, and certain vegetables or seed. It can also be a medicinal powder mixed with honey and �dibs� which is a date syrup, and with sugar; one gets in this case a great result which <b><font color="#FF0000">ranks in the class of jams</font></b></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>The poor also use the carrot in place of bread, that, for them, in a few cases, because it soothes hunger and the silent (little known?) fact, that it provides a healthy and nutritious diet. Lambouschad (contemporary with Plutarch� Boeotia, Greece?) recounts that the people of his country were making bread with carrots. They ground the carrots in dry pieces, added a certain quantity of wheat flour, barley, rice or millet. They completed the plan (process), and obtained a bread of good quality, healthful and nourishing.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>It can also be eaten with sugary preparations (jams) and salted products; only its flavour was more agreeable with tea first; it was more nutritious and more suitable for the body. There is one species of wild carrot; the latter is rather used in medicine, while the cultivated species is more often used as food than a medicine."&nbsp; <font size="2">(It was a widely followed rule that each Arabic agricultural book must include, even if brief, a description on the industrialisation of agricultural products. Examples regarding these include the preparation of raisins, dried fig, vinegar, pickles, jam, sugar, cotton, oils and perfumes. Arab culture included carrot, citron, pumpkin and peach jams.)</font></i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>.Al-Awwam writes that carrots were served with a dressing of oil and vinegar (as in Roman recipes of ad 200) or added to vegetable mixtures and cereals, probably grains. It also described how to preserve carrots in vinegar and the use of carrots in place of bread - <i>"</i><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><i>The poor also use the carrot in place of bread, that, for them, in a few cases, because it soothes hunger and the little known fact, that it provides a healthy and nutritious diet.

<p>At this time there were also published texts called antidotaria which were recipes for compounded medications. One of the more widespread ones was called Antidotarium Nicolai available in 1140. This was later used in the curriculum at the University of Paris by the late 13th century.</p>
<p>Nicholas of Salerno, also known as Nicolaus Salernitanus&nbsp; Italian physician who is traditionally considered the author of this famous medieval treatise on pharmacology and antidotes known as the Antidotarium Nicolai. This formulary is an important source of information about medieval pharmacy, materia medica, dentistry, and pharmacotherapy, and it was probably based on the anonymous Antidotarius magnus (composed between 1087 and 1100).</p>
<p>Here is what the text says about carrots:</p>

<p><b><font color="#FF0000">By the 13th century</font></b> scientific enquiry was returning and this was manifest through the production of encyclopaedias, those noted for their plant content included a treatise by Albertus Magnus (c.1193 -1280) a Suabian educated at the University of Padua and a tutor to St Thomas Aquinas). It was called De vegetabilibus (c.1256 AD) and even though based on original observations and plant descriptions rather than questions than medicine it bore a close resemblance to the earlier Greek, Roman and Arabic herbals</p>
<p>Carrots were being grown in fields, orchards, gardens, and vineyards in Germany and France. At that time the plant was known also in China, where it was supposed to have come from Persia. Doctors in the Middle Ages prescribed carrots as a medicine for every possible affliction, from syphilis to dog bites!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 1287 a relatively unknown and forgotten botanist Valgius Rufinus wrote "Of the Virtues of Herbs and of their Compositions"<br />
The prologue to the work states:</p>

<td width="869">
<blockquote><i>" And I have collected from the sayings of the ancient sages describing the virtues of the herbs and their workings in inferior bodies according to what they had experienced and the truth they were able to find concerning these.

And there is daucus Creticus which is called cartuge and there is another noble daucus which is called affanaria. Furthermore there is a daucus which is called pastumcellus. Its seeds cling to one's clothes. It is given for cricks,-detur pando ( ?)." Albertus has only four lines on dittany and his account of daucus seems limited to the Cretan variety.</p>
<p>The curious carrot later traversed the route eastward via European travellers and explorers to set its roots into India and the Far East during the 13th century. By the 14th century the Netherlands, France and Germany were introduced to the carrot. It took another century to reach England's shores during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.</p>

<p><b>Tractatus de herbis</b> (Herbal) <i>-</i> Egerton MS 747 held by the British Library was produced between 1280 and 1310 and is probably an original manuscript of Tractus de Herbis a type of medicinal herbal which was to become one of the most influential texts on medicinal plants between the 14th and 16th centuries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Written by Bartholomaei Mini de Senis; Platearius; Nicolaus of Salerno, it contains miniature illustrations of plants in colours, usually several on a page, together with their medicinal uses inherited from Greek, Roman and Arabic sources. It also covered instructions on how to prepare each fruit or vegetable. In some cases it gives suggestions on the aphrodisiac, cosmetic and magical properties of herbs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The illustrations are drawn from life wherever possible to produce identifiable likenesses but over the centuries these herbals were copied repeatedly by scribes and artists who were anxious to reproduce the books in front of them. Haste, lack of skill and misunderstandings frequently resulted in plant images that were simplified, distorted and often unrecognisable!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The 14th century&nbsp;</b> - saw carrot references starting to appear in main land Europe.</font></p>
<p>A large quantity of what appear to be processed fruits of Daucus carota L. were recently found in Rynek Glowny (the main market square) in Krakow in a medieval organic layer, dated to the 14th century AD. This therefore is perhaps the first archaeobotanical evidence indicating the cultivation of carrot in medieval Poland. Unprocessed carrot fruits, wild and cultivated forms being indistinguishable, are found in Europe from the Neolithic period onwards.</p>
<p>The sample appears to be seed for cultivation, probably sold in the main market square. Indeed, the find represents very strong evidence for medieval carrot cultivation in central Europe.&nbsp; <span lang="EN-GB">Carrots are not mentioned very often in Polish sources from the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> centuries. Carrots may have been implied under the general term olera .(vegetables for boiling) buy even the archaeological record is slim because the seeds do not preserve well in the ground and are difficult to differentiate from wild carrot. Carrots are only mentioned four times in the accounts of King Wladyslaw and Queen Jadwiga, yet in each case the implication is that these are specially cultivated and brought early to market. <i><font size="2">(source - Food and Drink in Medieval Poland Rediscovering a Cuisine of the Past Maria Dembinska. Translated by Magdalena Thomas)</font></i></span></p>
<p>An exceptionally large concentration of carrot fruits recovered from Krakow�s main market square represent the first convincing archaeobotanical evidence for carrot cultivation in medieval Poland. The fruits have deliberately had their spines removed, a process undertaken to prepare carrot fruits for sowing, and are statistically larger in size than other occasional carrot fruits recovered from medieval archaeological contexts in the city.</p>
<p>Due to Krakow�s location at the centre of important medieval trade routes between Asia and Europe, it is possible that they may be a part of that trade and imported from further afield. The city was situated at a crossroads of trade routes and played an important role in medieval trade, especially of oriental goods. In early medieval times Krakow had connections with Kiev, playing a crucial role in trade between Khazaria and Western Europe.<br />

<p align="left"><b>Henry Daniel</b> <font size="3"><b>1315 (approx) - 1385</b> Although little is known of Daniel's life, a good deal can be deduced from his surviving works, which include translations of medical treatises from the Latin and&nbsp;an extensive herbal,</font> De re Herbaria (1375). He must originally have been comparatively well-to-do, but later became poor and joined the Dominican Order.&nbsp; It was probably after entering religion that he was able to get access to the many authorities which he consulted in the compilation of his herbal.</p>
<p align="left">Daniel was a scholar of distinction and a student of medicine. He sought out works which, in many cases, must have been rare in English libraries, and his surviving translations are correct, clear, and forcibly expressed.&nbsp; In his youth Daniel studied medicine for seven years and in his later life had a large garden at Stepney, London, in which he grew 252 different kinds of plants, a very large number for the period.</p>
<p align="left">Carrots were named by Daniel in the list of habitats as - "growing in dry places, and in meers."</p>
<p>In approx 1350 it is known from archaeological evidence that they consumed a variety of vegetables, both grown in gardens and gathered in the wild in the British Isles. Vegetables known from Jorvík (modern&nbsp;York) or Dublin include carrots, parsnips, turnips, celery, spinach, wild celery, cabbage, radishes, fava beans and peas.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, France and Germany were introduced to the carrot. It took another century to reach England's shores during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. carrots had spread across north-western Europe. Poor country dwelling folk used the roots for soups that formed the main staple diet.</p>

<p>One of the earliest references to the red carrot in Europe comes from the Menagier of Paris who, in the 14th century, writes a series of instructions for his wife. The carrot at this time was apparently fairly new to the market for he feels it is necessary to describe for her how one may recognize the carrot&nbsp; (red root).</p>
<p><b>1393</b> - Le M�nagier de Paris (a medieval manuscript dated to circa 1393),&nbsp; contained an enormous chapter containing 197 pages of recipes, menus, and general cookery and household instructions. In the section dealing with "Other small and unnecessary things",&nbsp; it is advised to cook them like turnip, and where the author directs his wife how to find carrots (the root may have been rare at that time and place) they are described as red roots which are sold at the Halles in baskets, and each basket costs one blanc.<br />
&nbsp;<font size="2">From http://daviddfriedman.com/Medieval/Cookbooks/Menagier/Menagier.html</font></p>
<p>The script also included a recipe for carrots in honey - basically boiled and then cooked in honey! There are various sorts of jams, mostly made with honey; in the Middle Ages vegetables were evidently much prepared in this way, for the Menagier speaks of turnip, carrot, and pumpkin jam.</p>
<p>"Garroites sont racines rouges que l'en vent �s Halles par pongn�es, et chascune pongn�e un blanc."Garroites -</p>
<p>Item, on All Saints, take carrots as many as you wish, and when they are well cleaned and chopped in pieces, cook them like the turnips.</p>
<p>("Garroites [carrots?] are red roots that are sold out of (Les) Halles in bunches, and each bunch (costs) a blanc [a silver coin equivalent to a sixpence]."</p>
<p>By way of comparison, the cost per bunch is half the cost of a chicken at the time.) The "like turnips" is to cook them a bit in water (not over-cook), drop in cold water to stop them cooking, drain, and then put into lukewarm honey and soak for a long time (perhaps for a week, then start again with the honey lukewarm, until a month has gone by). <font size="2"><br />

<p>These manuscripts were based on an 11th century Arabic manuscript known as the Taqwim al-Sihha bi al-Ashab al- Sitta (Rectifying Health by Six Causes), which was a guide for healthy living written by the Christian physician and philosopher Abu al- Hasan al-Mukhtar ibn al-Hasan ibn �Abdun ibn Sa�dun Ibn Butlan (d. 1063), who was born and educated in Baghdad and whose travels took him to localities that are today in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Israel, and Turkey. The Taqwim was a guide for healthy living, based on ancient philosophical concepts of Greek sciences. It summarized in tabular form information on some 280 health-related items, in particular food and especially vegetables and fruits.</p>

<p><b>The Historia Plantarum</b> is an interesting and historically significant source about medicine and also about the everyday life of the Middle Ages. According to medieval doctors, various elements were needed for a healthy lifestyle: proper diet, exercise and enough sleep, and a balanced emotional state. A life in harmony with nature was recommended. This guaranteed people health and well-being. The illuminated manuscript is illustrated with over five hundred illustrations of plants in alphabetical order. The depictions convey an astoundingly detailed and imposing overview of the thorough knowledge about plant life, which one possessed in late medieval Italy. In addition to these botanical pictu<img border="0" src="herbals/ms459.jpg" align="right" alt="daucus creticus ms 459 Roma CARROT" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="201" height="306" />res come more than eighty illustrations of animals, from which one obtained healing remedies, as well as over 30 depictions of mineral derivatives.</p>
<p>Prominent Previous Owners - The manuscript was made at the end of the 14th century at the court of Gian Galeazzo Visconti. The ruler was the most powerful and glorious scion of the great Visconti family and created during his reign one of the most impressive collections of unbelievably valuable book treasures. Gian Galeazzo presented the splendid Historia Plantarum to Wenzel IV, King of Bohemia and Germany, with whom he forged a good political relationship.

The Taqwīm synthesised a variety of Greek-derived medical science and traditions and considered approximately 280 health-related items including food, drink, climate, bodily activities and clothing (source). The translation into Latin was commissioned by the Court of Naples and Sicily and completed by 1266 (source).

<p><i>When the dishes are well set to make different colors you have to take out a quarter of the jelly that is in the dish and put It on a jar and warm It. So, when the jelly is completely dissolved you can add saffron to make It yellow, and when It is cold you can put It again in the dish.</i></p>
<p><i>Then, when the jelly is formed again, you have to take out another quarter and follow the same process to make it red adding �corgnali� (unknown item)</i></p>
<p><i>To make a quarter of jelly green you need to ground wheat or barley unripe with some parsley.</i></p>
<p><i>In the same way you can make the jelly <b>purple with some cooked carrots</b>: after having cleansed them, you have to cut the root, that has the purple colour, and to put It in the jar in which the jelly is warmed, following the process used to make the others colours.</i></p>

<p>1475 - Carrot is also mentioned by Italian cook Bartolomeo Sacchi (a.k.a Platina) in his dish "Cariota" - Here are some words and, and recipes of sorts, for both the carrot and the parsnip. He considers them simply variations of the same medicinally useful vegetable.&nbsp; Probably in the summer of 1465 Platina composed De honesta voluptate et valetudine ("On honourable pleasure and health") considered by some to be the first printed cookbook, a monument of medieval cuisine in Renaissance intellectual trappings left the press in 1474 and ran into dozens of editions, disseminating Roman ideas about fine dining throughout Western Europe.<br />
<br />
(From De Honesta Voluptate (On Honest Indulgence and Good Health), Bartolomeo Platina, &nbsp;- On Right Pleasure and Good Health; Platina 1475, from the Milham translation).</p>
<blockquote><i>"Cariota - Roast carrots in the coals, then peel them, cleaning off the ashes, and cut them up. Put in a dish with oil, vinegar and a bit of wine; scatter a few mild herbs on the top.</i>
<p><i>On the Carrot and Parsnip - There are two kinds of parsnip (probably parsnip and carrot).&nbsp; Doctors say that the parsnip is white while the carrot is red or almost black.&nbsp; Both are difficult to digest and of little and harsh nourishment. The parsnip should be boiled twice, with the first water thrown away, and cooked with lettuce the second time. Transferred from there to a dish and seasoned with salt, vinegar, coriander, and pepper, it is suitable to eat, for it settles cough, pleurisy, and dropsy, and arouses passion. It is even customary for it to be rolled in meal and fried in oil and fat when it has been hollowed out after the first boiling.<br />
Carrot is seasoned in the same way as parsnip, but it is considered sweeter if cooked under warm ash and coals. When it is taken out, it should cool a little, be peeled, scraped entirely free of ash, cut up in bits and transferred in to a dish. Salt should be added, oil and vinegar sprinkled on, some condensed must or must added, and sweet spices sprinkled over. There is nothing more pleasant to eat than this. It is good for people in two respects, for it represses bile and moves the urine. In other ways it is harmful, as it is for liver, stomach, and spleen."</i></p>
<p>Another version Platina p. 68 (Book 4) <i>... The parsnip should be boiled twice, the first liquid thrown away and cooked the second time with lettuce. Then it is put on a plate and dressed with salt, vinegar, coriander, and pepper, and is very fit to serve. ... The carrot is prepared in the same way as the parsnip, but is considered more pleasant when cooked under warm ashes and coals..</i>. <font color="#FF0000">Modern Recipe</font> - 1 lb carrots 1/2 t salt 1/2 t coriander 2/3 lb lettuce 1 T + 1 t vinegar 1/12 t pepper Wash carrots, wash and tear up lettuce. Put carrots in boiling water, boil 12 minutes. Drain them. Put carrots and lettuce in boiling water for another 6 minutes. Drain them. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix thoroughly.</p>

<p>Carrot also appeared frequently in several Islamic cookery books of the 15th century including a famous one written by Ibn al-Mabrad. Here is one reference:</p>
<blockquote><b>Jazariyyah</b>&nbsp; p. 18 � A 15th C Eastern Islamic Cookbook&nbsp; - Meat is boiled with a little water. <b>Carrots</b>, garlic cloves and peeled onions are put with it, then crushed garlic is put with it. Some people put spinach with it also; some make it without spinach. Walnuts and parsley are put in. 2 lb meat (lamb) 4 very small onions (5 oz) 1/4 c walnuts [1/2 t pepper] 4 carrots (1 lb) 2 cloves crushed garlic 1/4 c parsley [3/4 t coriander] 6 whole garlic cloves (~ .6 oz) 2 c spinach = 5 oz [1 t cinnamon] [3/4 t salt] Cut the lamb up small and put it in 1 1/2 c water with cinnamon, pepper, coriander and salt. Simmer 10 minutes. Add carrots cut up, whole garlic cloves, and small onions. Simmer 10 minutes. Add crushed garlic. Simmer 20 minutes. Add spinach. Simmer 10 minutes. Garnish with walnuts and parsley.</blockquote>

<p>According to Hales History of Agriculture by dates (1915)</p>
<p>"1485.�Previous to the reign of Henry, VII., King of England, which began in this year, there did not grow in that country any vegetable or eatable root, such as carrot, parsnip, cabbage."</p>
<p>The end of the 15th century saw the <b>"The Columbian Exchange"</b> -&nbsp; the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the Americas and the Old World in the 15th and 16th centuries, related to European colonization and trade after Christopher Columbus's 1492 voyage. Invasive species and including communicable diseases, were a negative by-product of the Exchange. Carrots were amongst the list of plants being carried from the Old World to the New.</p>
<p>The new contact between the global populations circulated a wide variety of crops and livestock, which supported increases in population in both hemispheres, although diseases initially caused precipitous declines in the numbers of indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Columbian Exchange was a term coined by Alfred Crosby, was initiated in 1492.</p>
