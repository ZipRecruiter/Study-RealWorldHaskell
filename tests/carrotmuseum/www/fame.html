<p align="left">As the research for the World Carrot Museum produced more in depth and new information about the wonderful vegetable and its colourful history, so the site grew and grew. With this expansion the popularity of the World Carrot Museum came to the attention of the media. Set out below are some of the examples.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">Important Note</font>: You will notice that there are few records after 2009. This is not because the Museum has ceased educating the world about carrots. The mass media in their infinite wisdom often choose to ridicule, demean and devalue what the Carrot Museum does. It is an easy target to write about someone who is passionate about a subject and turn it into an obsession and run by someone who is clearly crazy.&nbsp; Nothing could&nbsp; be further from the truth.&nbsp; Also the truth is often distorted or totally misrepresented to make a more eye catching headline. <i>(It sells newspapers)</i></p>
<p align="left">Therefore, the Museum now regularly refuses to be interviewed about its activities. Responses to these refusals can be mis-read, that is their problem not mine. We have a favourite expression which is quite apposite in this instance:</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="4">"Never let the facts get in the way of a good story."</font></b></p>

<p>About 200 carrot-related items from the online collection of a man obsessed with the vegetable are on display. John Stolarczyk, is presenting dozens of carrot-themed collectibles, from candles and clocks to forks and fishing lure, at the Harlow Carr gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. Mr Stolarczyk, 56, a retired council officer, from Skipton, North Yorkshire, runs an internet museum devoted to the carrot. He says: �I eat them every day, at least once. I just love the taste of them. I also grow my own � red, purple, white and yellow carrot varieties.�</p>

<p><b>MSN gave the Museum a reference too - June 2007</b></p>
<p><b>Trusting your eyesight to carrots</b><br />
If you think these vegetables will improve your vision, think again. While carrots do contain vitamin A, which is a major player in keeping your eyes working properly, you really only need a small amount of it - and no matter how much vitamin A you consume, it�s not going to magically eliminate your need for glasses. In fact, if you eat too much vitamin A in pill form, you can end up with a toxic�although not usually fatal�reaction.</p>
<p>The idea that more carrots means better vision might actually be a relic of a World War II-era military disinformation campaign. According to the online World Carrot Museum, British intelligence began spreading the myth during the blitz as a plausible explanation for why their fighter pilots were suddenly able to spot Nazi planes at night. In reality, the British had simply developed a better radar system and didn�t want the enemy to find out about it.</p>

<p><b>Craven Herald 1 March 2007</b> - Carrot king customises his collection</p>
<blockquote>Carrot connoisseur John Stolarczyk has returned from Holtville, USA, the global carrot capital of the world, armed with more artefacts for his museum - the only one in the world devoted to the vegetable.
<p>The 56-year-old former Bradford Council administrator, whose favourite colour naturally is orange, gets more than 200 hits a day on his 125-page on-line museum.</p>
<p>His luggage was laden with a carrot miniature tenpin bowling set, a carrot-shaped bird box, a carrot-shaped bubble gum container, carrot-shaped chocolate, a carrot bird feeder, carrot candles, a windmill, a trinket box, towels and a carrot wreath.</p>
<p>They have now joined the other carrot cornucopia at his home in Clayton Hill Road, Cross Hills, near Keighley, where he already treasures carrot-based ornaments ranging from fairy lights to corkscrews.</p>
<p>Mr Stolarczyk said: "My biggest problem was getting the wreath through customs. It was in my backpack and they asked what it was. I told them I was a carrot collector and they eventually believed me."</p>
<p>He had been a guest of honour in the Californian town and took his place on a special float in the carrot parade.</p>
<p>With him was America's carrot tattoo lady - Michele - who persuaded John to have his own "temporary" tattoo, and Jeff Chiplis, of Cleveland, Ohio, who has a collection of 10,000 carrot bags.</p>
<p>Mr Stolarczyk was invited to judge a carrot cooking competition in which people made sweets, cakes and savoury dishes from the vegetable.</p>
<p>"I think we're a rare breed or perhaps there are a lot of closet carrot collectors," he said.</p>

<p><b>Keighley News</b> 8 March 2007 <a href="klynews.html">click here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Huddersfield Examiner</b> 8 March 2008 - The simple carrot, yet it�s so very good for our health</p>
<blockquote>�The carrot�s nutritional value is unquestionable and scientist have shown that the value increases when they are cooked!�
<p>Take a gentle stroll across some of our beautiful coastal dunes and chalky cliffs in mid-summer and you may see stems with typical pure white Umbelliferae flower spikes up to a metre (3ft) tall. You are not allowed to dig these up under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. So pick a leaf off, crush and smell it � the distinct carrot aroma � this is the wild carrot, Daucus carota.</p>
<p>From this wild relative, dating from over 5,000 years ago, we now have hundreds of varieties to choose from in a whole rainbow of colours. Its popularity in the Middle East continued for centuries until the crop at last found its way into Europe in the 14th century. It finally arrived on our shores in the 15th century with Flemish refugees.</p>
<p>Over the following 500 years its importance, its quality, its flavour and size all increased dramatically. So by the time we had reached the Dig for Victory campaign of the Second World War, the carrot was part of our staple diet and a popular allotment and showing crop. Its nutritional value is unquestionable and scientist have shown that the value increases when they are cooked! Carotene, known as a powerful antioxidant, increases after cooking and will increase even more if you do not peel the carrots. Vitamins B, C, D and E are also present in valuable quantities.</p>
<p>For anything else that you want to know about carrots visit www.carrotmuseum.co.uk � but only if you have a day or two to spare!</p>
