<div align="left">A manuscript is hand written information that has been manually created by one or more people,&nbsp; as opp<a href="photos/ms747egertonlge.jpg"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="photos/ms747egertonsm.jpg" alt="ms747 Egerton Tractus de Herbis" width="167" height="453" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" /></font></a>osed to being printed or reproduced some other way. The term may also be used for information that is hand-recorded in other ways than writing, for example inscriptions that are chiselled upon a hard material or scratched (the original meaning of graffiti) as with a knife point in plaster or with a stylus on a waxed tablet (the way Romans made notes), or are in cuneiform writing, impressed with a pointed stylus in a flat tablet of unbaked clay. <i>(Left - Tractatus de herbis (Herbal); De Simplici Medicina ; Circa instans; Antidotarium Nicolai, 1280-1310,&nbsp; Egerton MS 747 f. 33 Carrot - <font size="2">Source: British Library Illuminated Manuscripts</font></i>).
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carrots are said to have been recognised as one of the plants in the garden of the Egyptian king Merodach-Baladan in the eighth century B.C.&nbsp; There is no documentary evidence for this and the clay tablet, held in British Museum, with cuneiform inscription gives a list of plants in the garden of an earlier Babylonian king, Marduk-apla-iddina, the Biblical Merodach-Baladan, who reigned at Babylon in 721�710 and 703 BC.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">It would probably have been placed amongst the aromatic herbs along with fennel, suggesting that the root was discounted, using only the&nbsp;pleasantly scented flowers and leaves in cooking. Merodach Baladan was the king of Babylon in 702 b.c., a Chaldean and father of Nabopolassar and grandfather of Nebuchadnezzar. <img border="0" src="photos/babylontablet.jpg" width="225" height="299" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="5" /></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The clay tablet is shown right <a target="_blank" href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=3066115&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=Merodach-Baladan+II&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=/research/search_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1">here (British Museum)</a>. It lists 67 plants and appear in two columns, subdivided into groups, perhaps to represent plant beds. Only 26 plant names have been identified with certainty including leeks, onion garlic, lettuce,radish, cucumber, gherkin, cardamom, caraway, dill, thyme, oregano, fennel, coriander, cumin and fenugreek.Many remain to be identified. Carrot is currently not amongst those identified, though some of the above identified are umbellifers.</span></p>
<p>One of the first late medieval herbals to depict plants and vegetables accurately, although it may have been based on a now lost Byzantine prototype. Such illustrated handbooks of health, as well as numerous herbals, offer a rich visual record of the sorts of vegetables deemed worthy by the physicians and for the dining table in that period.</p>
<p>Colours in illustrations obviously degrade over time depending on such factors as type and availability of materials used and storage methods.&nbsp; If then you also factor in personal artistic interpretation, the colours we currently see in manuscripts and hand coloured books may well have changed over time and cannot be regarded as definitive.</p>
<p>Another point to bear in mind is that many manuscripts are copies, or interpretations of earlier manuscripts. This is evident in another paper co-authored by the Carrot Museum Curator - "Synteny of Images in Three Illustrated Dioscoridean Herbals: Juliana Anicia Codex (JAC), Codex Neapolitanus (NAP), and Morgan 652" - where it was concluded that M652 illustrations are based on images from both JAC and NAP. A database of the three herbals is available online <a href="http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/herbalimages">www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/herbalimages</a>. It was previously shown that 44% of the images in JAC and NAP are common to both herbals.</p>

<p>The above-ground parts of plants tend to be showy, but often the roots are hidden from view. Though roots are endowed with the beauty of nature, they are enmeshed with the mystery of the unknown. Roots have been both a boon and hazard to humans. They have been used as drugs and poisons and as food. They have been the sources of comfort in myths of fairies and forest nymphs, as well as a source of fear in popular legends of devils and curses. A rich association has existed between people and roots throughout and before the development of "civilized" societies. This relationship was most often one of dependence on roots as a source of food, then medicine. But sometimes because of their appearance, colour, odour or actual chemical properties roots were given a special importance by ancient peoples.</p>
<p>Herbals are a particularly interesting group in the history of written communication in that they have always been in circulation since the antiquities and were not 'rediscovered' during the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Despite the faithful transcription of the manuscript text by monastic scribes, distortions inevitably crept in as the work passed from one hand to the next. Greater variation exists among the illustrations which were often painted without reference to the living world. Regional variation in both plant types and knowledge as well as differences in editorial control also contributed over a thousand years of copying to a body of herbal manuscripts deriving from a few ancient sources.</p>
<p>This all makes for a complex history but there are two lines or branches generally identified in classifying the lineage of a herbal. Perhaps the most important is the five volume pharmacopoeia/herbal, 'De Materia Medica' by Dioscorides from the first century AD, which represents the Greek/Arabic tradition. This work also supplies much of the textual origin for the other branch, the latin tradition, referred to as Pseudo-Apuleius (sometimes called Apuleius Platonic, to distinguish him or them from a number of other authors from the middle ages called Apuleius). The original Pseudo-Apuleius Herbal was produced in about the 5th century AD.</p>

A typical example (left) is Adam Lonitzer's Kreuterbuch - Frankfurt 1582 - A very early manuscript clearly shows an orange root, entitled "Pastenachen M�ren Pastinaca sativa, &amp; sylvestris".</p>
<p align="left"><i><font size="2">(Photo, compliments of the Smithsonian Digital Collection of Early manuscripts.)</font></i></p>
<p align="left">Like other manuscript books, herbals were "published" through repeated copying by hand, either by professional scribes or by the readers themselves. In the process of making a copy, the copyist would often translate, expand, adapt, or reorder the content. Most of the original herbals have been lost; many have survived only as later copies (of copies of copies!), and many others are known only through references from other texts, with pictures not made from direct natural observation.&nbsp; They tend to follow the same pattern&nbsp; - the plant's physical appearance, smell, taste and natural habitat, followed by a discussion on any known medicinal qualities, culinary virtues, and then any useful products obtained from the plants roots, leaves, seeds or flowers. Sadly colour variations (of carrot) were rarely described until much later.</p>
<p align="left">European herbal medicine is rooted in the works of classical writers such as Pliny the Elder who wrote Historia Naturalis <a href="pliny.html">(here)</a>; and Dioscorides <a href="dioscorides.html">(here)</a>, a Greek physician and author of the first known illustrated guide to medicinal plants whose De Materia Medica (78 C. E.) formed the basis of herbals in Europe for 1,500 years and the most influential herbal of all time.</p>
<p align="left">For most of human history, people have relied on herbalism for at least some of their medicinal needs, and this remains true for more than half of the world's population in the twenty-first century. Much of our modern pharmacopoeia also has its roots in the historical knowledge of medicinal plants.</p>

<div align="left">The oldest known manuscript of Dioscorides work is the Juliana Anicia Codex (ca. 512 A.D.), housed in the Austrian National Library in Vienna. Listed as Codex Vindobonensis Medicus Graecus 1, it is better known as the �Vienna Dioscorides,� the oldest and most valuable work in the history of botany and pharmacology.&nbsp; Similar images are also included in Codex Neapolitanus, shown below, a 6th century manuscript which drew heavily on the images contained in the above mentioned AD 512 "Vienna" Codex.
<p>The World Carrot Museum has the honour of having an article published in the renowned academic journal Chronica Horticulturae, co-authored with Jules Janick, the James Troop Distinguished Professor in Horticulture, Department of Horticulture &amp; Landscape Architecture, Purdue University (USA).&nbsp;&nbsp; The item is called <b>Carrot History and Iconography</b> a fascinating journey through the Carrot's development from Wild to Orange and beyond.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.actahort.org/chronica/pdf/ch5102.pdf">Full copy here</a> (page 13 onwards). <a href="../finaljournal.pdf">Extract here.</a></p>
<p><span style="color:black">There are many surviving manuscripts of De Materia Medica after Codex Vindobonensis, an important example being the seventh-century Greek alphabetic Codex Neapolitanus, in the possession of a Neapolitan monastery for many years, and then presented to Emperor Charles VI in 1717. It was taken to Vienna and subsequently to the Bibliotheca Nazionale in Naples. Some of the drawings in Codex Neapolitanus are thought to be from the same source as Codex Vindobonensis, but are smaller and grouped together on fewer pages.</span></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In some cases it gives suggestions on the aphrodisiac, cosmetic and magical properties of herbs.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The illustrations are drawn from life wherever possible to produce identifiable likenesses but over the centuries these herbals were copied repeatedly by scribes and artists who were anxious to reproduce the books in front of them. Haste, lack of skill and misunderstandings frequently resulted in plant images that were simplified, distorted and often unrecognisable!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It contains numerous miniatures of plants in colours, usually several on a page. Initials in red or blue, some with penwork decoration in the other colour. This is the record for Daucus. <i>(picture right)</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The �Circa instans� was an extremely popular text. Preserved in about 240 surviving manuscripts, and translated into several vernacular languages (English, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Danish, Hebrew and Serbian), it was first printed in 1497 in Venice. It also became an authoritative source for several other herbals, pharmacological collections, and encyclopedias, at least until the 16th century.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Pharmacy was one of the pillars of medical therapy during antiquity and the Middle Ages. Medicaments were derived from the natural world (plants, minerals and animals), and resulted from the combination of different substances, each with specific properties and therapeutic effects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Finally, we should not forget that the �Circa instans� was not only read and used for medical purposes. It also became the basis for a tradition of illustrated herbals conveying visual knowledge of the natural world, and often produced for reading pleasure rather than practical purposes.</font></p>

<p align="left"><b>The Historia Plantarum (1395)</b> is an interesting and historically significant source about medicine and also about the everyday life of the Middle Ages. According to medieval doctors, various elements were needed for a healthy lifestyle: proper diet, exercise and enough sleep, and a balanced emotional state. A life in harmony with nature was recommended. This guaranteed people health and well-being. The illuminated manuscript is illustrated with over five hundred illustrations of plants in alphabetical order. The depictions convey an astoundingly detailed and imposing overview of the thorough knowledge about plant life, which one possessed in late medieval Italy. In addition to these botanical pictu<img border="0" src="herbals/ms459.jpg" align="right" alt="daucus creticus ms 459 Roma CARROT" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="201" height="306" />res come more than eighty illustrations of animals, from which one obtained healing remedies, as well as over 30 depictions of mineral derivatives.</p>

The ruler was the most powerful and glorious scion of the great Visconti family and created during his reign one of the most impressive collections of unbelievably valuable book treasures. Gian Galeazzo presented the splendid Historia Plantarum to Wenzel IV, King of Bohemia and Germany, with whom he forged a good political relationship. Today the medical encyclopedia is found in the Biblioteca Casanatense in Rome. <i>(Image right fol 85r daucus creticus (cretan carrot)</i></p>

The Taqwīm synthesised a variety of Greek-derived medical science and traditions and considered approximately 280 health-related items including food, drink, climate, bodily activities and clothing The translation into Latin was commissioned by the Court of Naples and Sicily and completed by 1266. <i>&nbsp;(<a href="https://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/103/8/1187.full.pdf+html">source</a> - The Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae illustrated in medieval manuscripts known as the Tacuinum Sanitatis).</i> <i><a href="http://medievalmanuscriptsunlocked.blogspot.com/2016/10/historia-plantarum-biblioteca.html">(main source)</a></i></p>
<p align="left">The Codex contains 295 large format images that make up the manuscript, followed by over five hundred illustrations of plants. The quality and finish provides a detailed and impressive picture of the vastness of knowledge of the plant world reached in Italy at the end of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p align="left">This Latin version was copied repeatedly and circulated around Europe, with the first illustrated copies being commissioned in the late 14th Century by northern Italian nobility (source). <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">The codex is beautifully illuminated by the workshop of Giovannino de 'Grassi.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Derivative copies merged abbreviated versions of the Tacuinum sanitatis (usually the entries regarding food) with medical encyclopaedias and/or Theoprastus' Historia Plantarum, an early botanical handbook that included the medical uses of plants. This copy consists of the Historia Plantarum followed by some Tacuinum sanitatis entries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">There is some ambiguity between the text and the image. It refers to parsnip and yet the image is described in carrot terms. e.g. <i>(rough translation)</i> <i>"<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">The plant starts from a tripartite carrot with black marks that wrap around it, the stem is very high, the first leaves branch off at the middle of the stem on racemes of five palmate laminae, deeply incised, toothed; these present the reason for the chromatic division of the page; however, since the leaf is normally palminervia (leaf whose main nerves are born from the point of union between the limbus and the petiole.), with a division so marked along the axis of symmetry, a paradoxical and absolutely unrealistic effect is created. The umbrellas, five in number, have elegant skeletal bracts and are equally stylized. The flower has now closed, bringing the flowers to maturity, the image of the collected inflorescence forms a network of rays that converge at the apex of the scape and form a weave (stylized with a net motif) at the base of the Umbrella itself."</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Here is a rough translation of the text relating to daucus cretica in respect of its medicinal qualities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b>Uses</b> - The dauco cretico is also known as the wild parsnip. It is warm at the beginning and end of the third degree. It is a fairly well-known herb. Its flowers and above all the seeds enter into the preparation of medicines, minus the leaves and the root. They are of two species: the dauco cretico and the dauco asinino. The cretico is of greater utility and is so called because it is found mainly on the island of Crete. It is highly effective. The asinino (donkey) takes the place of the cretico because this is present in small quantities. It enjoys high efficacy in flowers, seeds, leaves and even in the root. It can be kept for a year and must be renewed every year. It enjoys the virtue of dissolving stone, and aiding the break of wind. It is diuretic and thinner than matter. Against cold, asthma and wet and cold cough is given in with a decoction of dried figs. Against the cold phlegm a bag of dust made with this leaves and well heated is placed on the head. (a poultice)<br />
<br />
Against the pain of the stomach due to windiness and against stranguary, dysuria (difficulty in urination) and colitis disorders for chilling, the wine of its decoction is given and the grass is also placed in a large quantity cooked in wine and oil over the sore place. Against the stranguary and dysuria, against the pain of the liver from cold and against dropsy is made a syrup with the juice of its decoction of seeds. Against the hardness of the spleen and liver the leaves are is placed in large quantities in the wine and in the oil and is macerated in them for 10 days. On the eleventh day it is cooked until only the oil remains, the leaves are is squeezed well and the pouring is put on the fire to join the wax and make the plaster.<br />
<br />
Against the hardnesses and the other apostemes (swelling filled with puss) is sufficiently suitable, according to Constantine.</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Translation</b> - It is a fairly common plant which has a flower as wide as flowers of the elder tree, and in the middle it has a little red spot. It grows best in dry places. There are two kinds: one is called daucus creticus because it grows in Crete, the other is called daucus asinus because donkeys eat it. Daucus creticus is the better kind. Its greatest virtue is in the flower and the root, for the plant has hardly any virtue. It should be picked when it flowers, the root removed and put to dry in the shade. It keeps its qualities for a year.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It lightens and disperses the humors, and it is diuretic because of the fine quality of its substance. For asthma provoked by a cold humor and for a cold moist cough, give the decoction of this plant with dried figs and wine. For cold catarrh, fill a sachet with powdered carrot and place it hot on the head. To ease stomach pain caused by flatulence and cold humors, stranguary, dysury and impossibility of urinating, pain in the lower belly, colic and gripes, give wine in which this plant has cooked and at the same time cook large quantities of the plant with wine and oil and apply this to the painful places. To treat stone and impossibility of urinating, give the wine in which carrot and saxifrage seed have been cooked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For obstruction of the liver and spleen caused by cold, and for dropsy, make a syrup of fennel juice with the decoction of this plant. To relieve hardness of the liver and spleen, put to soak in wine and oil for ten days a large amount of this plant, boil until the oil has disappeared, then strain. Put some wax into this filtrate and make an ointment. This is very effective in reducing hardness of apostumes.&nbsp;</font></p>

The method of arrangement is his own.&nbsp; He indicates the localities and times of flowering in the Low Countries, information that could not have been derived from an earlier writer.</p>
<p>It is written in Latin and later translated and enhanced by Henry Lyte (below). Also much of Dodoens work is repeated by Gerard's translation (also below).</p>

<p align="left"><b>Henry Lyte (1529 - 1607)</b> was an English botanist and antiquary who published "A niewe Herball" (1578), which was a translation of the Cruydeboeck of Rembert Dodoens (Antwerp, 1564). This herbal, or historie of plants was subtitled "Wherein is contained the whole discourse and perfect description of all sorts of herbs and plants."&nbsp; Written in old English, it is a fascinating summary of the carrot at the time in England. Basically an English copy of Dodoens earlier work.</p>
<p align="left">He did not perhaps add very greatly to the knowledge of English botany, but he did a valuable service in introducing Dodoens' herbal into England. He said the root of the garden carrots (compared to wild) is more convenient and better to be eaten.</p>
<p>The title of Lyte's book is as follows: <i>'A Niewe Herball or Historie of Plantes : wherin is contayned the whole discourse and perfect description of all sortes of Herbes and Plantes : their divers and sundry kindes : their straunge Figures, Fashions, and Shapes : their Names, Natures, Operations, and Vertues : and that not onely of those which are here growyng in this our Countrie of Englande, but of all others also of forrayne Realmes, commonly used in Physicke. First set foorth in the Doutche or Almaigne tongue, by that learned D. Rembert Dodoens, Physition to the Emperour : And nowe first translated out of French into English, by Henry Lyte Esquyer.'</i></p>
<blockquote><i><b>Of Carrots (Chap xxxviii)</b> (<font size="2">note this has been edited by the Carrot museum Curator for ease of reading)</font></i>
<p align="left"><i>The Kinds - There be three sortes of Carrots, yealow and red whereof&nbsp; two be tame of the garden, the third is wild growing of it selfe.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>The Description -</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>1.The yealow Carrot hath dark greene leaves, all cut and hackt almost like the leaves of Chervil, but a great deal</i><img border="0" src="photos/lytedaucus.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="181" height="339" /> <i>browner, larger, stronger, and smaller cut. The root is thicke and long, yealow both without and within and is used to be eaten in meates.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>2. The red Carrot is like to the aforesaid in the cuts of his leaves, and in stalks, flowers and seed. The root is likewise long and thicke, but of a purple red colour both within and without.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>3. The wilde is not much unlike garden Carrot, in leaves stalks and flowers, saving the leaves be a little rougher, and not so much cut or jagged. In the middle of the flowry tufts amongst the white flowers groweth one or two little purple marks or specks. The seede is rougher and the root smaller and harder than the other Carrots.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>The Place -&nbsp; 1 &amp; 2&nbsp; the manured or tamed Carrot is sowne in gardens; 3 the wild groweth in the borders of fields, by high waies &amp; paths, and in</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>rough untoiled places.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>The Time -Carrots do flower in June and July, and their seed is ripe in August.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>He went on to describe its vertues which included, "cleaning evil blood"; "seeds to provoketh urine"; "this root hath the power to increase love".</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>The roots made into powder helped the "liver, spleen, kidnies and guarded against gravel".</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Wild Carrot provoketh womens flowers, and drunk with wine helped in childbirth. It also good against venom and the bitings &amp; stings of venomous beasts.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>The greene leaves of Carrots "boiled with honey and laid to, do cleanse and mundifie (purify) uncleane and fretting sores" (- a type of poultice)</i></p>

This is another version of the work of Dioscorides Pedanius, of Anazarbos,translated by Andr�s de Laguna, ‏1499-1559.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This book exemplifies the transfer of knowledge across the centuries. During the first century, the Greek doctor and apothecary Dioscorides, who is considered the father of pharmacology, wrote a very important document on botany and pharmaceuticals. In the 10th century, during the times of ʻAbd al-Rahman III (891−961), caliph of Cordova, the work was translated into Arabic. In 1518 at the Escuela de Traductores de Toledo (the School of Translators of Toledo), Antonio de Nebrija made the first translation of the work in Spain into Latin. In 1555 in the city of Antwerp (present-day Belgium, then ruled by Spain), the publisher Juan Lacio (circa 1524�66) published a Spanish translation from the Latin, which was done by Andr�s Laguna, the doctor of the Pope Julius III. On his frequent trips to Rome, Laguna consulted a variety of codices as well as the books on medicinal plants produced in Venice by the herbalist Pietro Andrea Matthioli. (source: Library of Congress <a href="https://www.wdl.org/en/item/10632/">https://www.wdl.org/en/item/10632/</a>) Note: Both images were identical, Laguna decided to add colour, thus confirming the existence of purple (or deep red) roots in the 16th century.</p>

<p align="left">It has long been considered one of the most famous of English herbals.&nbsp;It was republished in 1633 revised and enlarged by Thomas Johnson in an edition that retained much of the original Elizabethan text.&nbsp; The 1633 edition contains some 2850 descriptions of plants and about 2700 illustrations.</p>
<p><b>Stinking and Deadly Carrots</b> - both the plants are Thapsia, a relative of carrots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gerard added 182 new plants and appended some of his own observations. The work is a valuable source for the culinary historian, not only to prove certain plants were known at this time, but also to see how they were used.</p>

<p>Finally ... for completeness ...&nbsp; The bizarre <b>Voynich Manuscript</b> - described as an elegant enigma and the most mysterious book in the world, and "A Textbook of Medieval Plant Physiology" - <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">has long been noted that some of the Voynich botanical illustrations suggest carrots.</span></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Note the Carrot Museum does not endorse or agree with the assumptions and assignment of carrot to any of the images or text, but provides the information given below as a matter of interest only.&nbsp;</font> Neither the leaf nor root depictions show little or no similarity with Daucus Carota.&nbsp; The script contains many somewhat carrot shaped, orange/brown colored roots that one could forward a tenuous argument for several images being carrot. Until someone in authority can come forward with a reliable decoding and translation of the mystery script it is remains difficult to treat it seriously.</p>
<p>The enigmatic Voynich manuscript, undecipherable to scholars for more than a century, is a 16th century Mexican manuscript, according to a new book written by Purdue University and Delaware State University professors. Janick and Tucker conclude the Voynich Codex is a compendium of Aztec knowledge that is largely medicinal and herbal but includes information on astronomy, astrology and ritual bathing. The Voynich Codex is of extreme historical importance as it contains seminal information of New Spain unfiltered though Spanish or Inquisitorial censors.</p>
<p>Janick and Tucker are continuing to identify the plants pictured in the Voynich manuscript and plan to continue publishing their findings.</p>
<p>The discovery, which also identifies the manuscript�s author and illustrator, is a collaboration between Jules Janick, Distinguished Professor of Horticulture at Purdue University, and Arthur O. Tucker, Emeritus Herbarium Director at Delaware State University. Contributions to the book were made by Fernando Moreira, a Canadian linguist, and Elizabeth A. Flaherty, a Purdue wildlife ecologist.</p>
<p>The evidence is contained in �Unraveling the Voynich Codex,� recently released by Springer Nature. Key evidence for the Mexican origin of the Voynich Codex includes identification of Mexican plants and animals as well as clarification of a kabbalah-like map that shows landmarks of central Mexico.</p>
<p>The three plants labelled �okae89″, show similarities. The one on f101v2 is said to look very much like a carrot, and the other two could also be carrots <i>(There are several more images in the script which could be interpreted to look more like carrots than the ones shown here!)</i>:</p>
