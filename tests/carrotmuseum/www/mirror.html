<p><i><b>Only in the UK!!!</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Daily Mirror � UK 25 September 2003<br />
<br />
<br />

HEALTH chiefs sent teachers instructions - on how children should eat carrots.</b></i></p>
<p align="left"><br />
Emails marked "Urgent" told them: "Wash them, eat them from the bottom, discard the top."&nbsp; It said that was the method recommended by the Department of Health in Whitehall.</p>
<p align="left">One primary school head binned the "ridiculous" instructions.</p>
<p align="left">Schools were given free carrots last week under the �42million National Schools Fruit Scheme, which promotes healthy diet. Since March four to six-year-olds have received free apples, bananas and oranges. The email was sent by Salford Primary Care Trust, which runs the scheme in Greater Manchester.</p>
<p align="left">Tim Buckley, head of Tithe Barn Primary in Heaton Moor, said: "It didn't explain how far up the carrot we were supposed to stop eating. We just cut the tops and bottoms off." Sue Moscoe, head of Orrishmere Primary in Cheadle Hulme, said: "We threw it straight in the bin. It was unbelievable."</p>
<p align="left">Graham Brock, deputy head of Springwood Primary in Romiley, said: "They wouldn't send instructions on how to eat an apple so why a carrot?"</p>
<p align="left">But Maureen Crane, a teacher at St Matthew's Primary in Edgeley, thought it was sensible. She said: "It reminded us to wash them before cutting off the tops and eating them. I don't see anything wrong with that."</p>
<p align="left">Sylvia Cheater, regional head of the National Schools Fruit Scheme, said: "I hope our instructions didn't come across as patronising but sometimes we have to give people a full explanation."<br />
