<font color="#FF0000"><b>18th Century&nbsp;</b></font> By the 1700's Holland was the leading country in carrot breeding and today's "modern" orange version is directly descended from the Dutch-bred carrots of this time.. At the time four main orange varieties existed - Early Half Long, Late Half Long, Scarlet Horn and Long Orange. All modern Hybrids are derived from these four strains. It was attractive enough to figure in several Dutch masters paintings. See the <a href="art1.html">Art page</a> for some truly great works of art featuring carrots. Many cookbooks prior to the 1850s attempted to merge medicine with cookery. As a result, many dangerous, even deadly, "cure-alls" are given, reflecting the primitive medical knowledge of that era.
<p>In this period many new ways had been gradually found of utilising the materials for food, and vegetables were growing more plentiful. The carrot was predominantly used in soups, puddings, and tarts.</p>
<p>The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary; Or, The Accomplish'd Housewife's Companion (1723) by John Nott was a very early reference to recipes with carrots as the main ingredient. (below)</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="photos/knott1723sm.jpg" width="585" height="1011" /></p>
<p>In Batty Langley's New Principles of Gardening (1728) he describes the three primary varieties of carrots - Yellow (or Orange), Red and Wild as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>"Of Carrots we have three kinds, viz. The yellow or orange carrot, the red Carrot, and the wild or white Carrot; of which the yellow is the most valuable, called in Greek staphilinus, in Latin Pastinaca sativa tenuifolia, in High Dutch Geelruben, in Low Dutch Geel Peen, Pooteen of Wortelen, in French Carotte, in Italian Pastinaca, in Spanish Zanahoria and in English yellow Carrot.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>The root is of an orange (rather than a Limon) Colour both without and within. I have had carrots of this kind that have been twenty two inches in length and of twelve inches in circumference. And although Carrots of a very large size are much valued by many, I cannot recommend them as much as the middling size which are always much sweeter and less insipid.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>The Red Carrot is of the same form, both in Leaves, Stalk, Seed and Root, but very rarely grows so large. Its Leaves are of a dark reddish green, and its root of a blackish red without, and yellowish within; and is very seldom cultivated in our gardens.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(This is probably a reference to the purple carrot, which by this time is disappearing in England.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>The Wild Carrot is called in Greek staphilinus agrios, in Latin Pastinaca Sylvestris tenuifolia by some Daucus, in High Dutch wild Pastenen, Vogel nest, in Low Dutch Vogels nest and wild Caroten, Crookens cruyt, in French Pastenade Sauvage, in England wild Carrot, and after the Dutch Birds Nest. the roots are very small and a mean length and often white."</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can read all of more than 5 pages of Langley�s notes about carrots at <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753000819141#page/n271/mode/2up">Archive.org here</a>.</p>

<p>In 1736 E. Smith's wrote "Compleat Housewife," and included this delicious and unusual recipe -</p>
<blockquote>To make <b>Carrot or Parsnip Puffs</b>:�Scrape and boil your carrots or parsnips tender; then scrape or mash them very fine, add to a pint of pulp the crumb of a penny-loaf grated, or some stale biscuit, if you have it, some eggs, but four whites, a nutmeg grated, some orange-flower-water, sugar to your taste, a little sack, and mix it up with thick cream. They must be fry'd in rendered suet, the liquor very hot when you put them in; put in a good spoonful in a place.</blockquote>

<p>By 1749 it appears that England was exporting carrots, via the Dutch East India Company. The ship "Amsterdam", built in 1748 in Amsterdam, was lost during her maiden voyage, outward bound for Batavia, the modern Djakarta, in January 1749 near the little town of Hastings on the south coast of England. The excavations of the wreck form part of an integrated historical and archaeological programme to create relevant historical models for understanding the ship and its contents. Among the different kinds of vegetable remains, such as the seeds of spinach, <b>carrot</b>, wild radish, beet, purslane, black mustard and coriander. In addition to rice, wheat and other cereals, seeds and pips of fruits like figs and blackberries were found. <i><font size="2">(Source - East Indiaman Amsterdam research 1984-1986 J Gawronski - ANTIQUITY 64 (1990): 363-75)</font></i></p>
<p>John Wesley,MA 1747 wrote "A Primitive Physic, an easy and natural method of curing most diseases", this included carrots in several "cures" -</p>

<p>1747 Prussian chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, 38, discovered that beets and carrots contain small amounts of sugar.</p>
<p>1747 The New English Dispensary indicates - Various species all used in medicine -Wild Carrot seed infused in ale is an esteemed diuretic, and excellent to prevent the stone and alleviate its more violent fits. It also expels gravel and provokes urine and the menses. Domestic carrot has dark red roots.&nbsp; the roots are frequently used in food though they are flatulent. They are thought to render the body soluble and contribute to the cure of the cough. A dram of seeds of white carrot reduced to a powder are exhibited in Baum water as a specific against hysteric fits. <a href="englishdispensary1747.pdf">(Extract here)</a></p>
<p>1751 John Hill wrote "A History of Materia Medica,&nbsp; containing descriptions of all the substances used in medicine"&nbsp; in which in chapter 23 he comme<img border="0" src="photos/antidote1.jpg" alt="Thomas Short 1751 antidote wild carrot seed" align="right" width="423" height="265" />nted&nbsp;&nbsp; (full <a href="johnhill1751.pdf">extract here</a>, pdf)</p>
<p><i>"There are two kinds of daucus seeds kept in the shops, daucus creticus and daucus vulgaris.&nbsp; Creticus was found to breed insects and therefore had no virtue. It principally came from Germany or the Levant (eastern Mediterranean -&nbsp; specifically Anatolia). Creticus was described as having a long root, the thickness of a mans finger. Vulgaris was called the common or wild carrot with a short and broad root, terminating obtusely at the end. It's colour was dark brown and tasted similar to Cretan carrot but weaker and fainter. The seeds of both plants have similar virtues described as being powerful diuretics as well as good carminatives and uterines. The Cretic kind is one of the four lesser hot seeds in the shops and enters into some officinal compositions."</i></p>
<p>(Cretan carrot seeds were used in ancient recipes for universal panacea drugs such as <b>"Theriac</b> or <b>theriaca</b>" (also known as Venetian Treacle) which was a medical concoction originally formulated by the Greeks in the 1st century AD - modern treacle derives from this - History of Theriac - <a href="https://www.historyonthenet.com/theriac-historys-amazing-wonder-drug" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">https://www.historyonthenet.com/theriac-historys-amazing-wonder-drug</a>)</p>
<p>1751 Thomas Short, MD of Sheffield (UK) wrote an account of the nature, virtues and uses of physical pants found in Great Britain, commonly called "Medicina Britannica". He gave several references to the use of wild carrot seeds in several concoctions, including an antidote to poisons. <i>(218, above right)</i></p>

<p>In January 1766 a Mr. Young, in his treatise upon the management of hogs, was of opinion that "boiled carrots are the best food for fattening that useful animal. He prefers them to pollard, white pease, buck wheat, or potatoes". (Reported in a collection of Georgical essay, published in 1802 - <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/georgicalessays01hunt">archive.org here</a></p>
<p>The therapeutic use of seeds occurred again in 1772 when Nicholas Robinson, MD Royal College of Physicians, wrote his complete "Treatise of Stones, Gravel and all other sabulous secretions wherein are discovered the Great virtues of Burdoc and Wild Carrot Seeds."&nbsp; This work recommends "a tea made with wild carrot seeds sweetened with Lisbon sugar, and to drink half a pint at night and morning and in 3 days the pain is greatly relieved and in 5 days gone altogether. This "remedy" is a diuretic <i>(which carrot seeds are)</i> cause greater discharge of gravel from the kidneys and bladder than naturally would discharge from these organs." <i><font size="2">(source Wellcome Library Medical Tracts 321).</font></i></p>

<p>People were becoming more interested in the colour of carrots at this time helped by, Philip Miller writing in The Gardeners Dictionary in 1768:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are several varieties of the Garden Carrots, which differ in the colour of their roots, and these variations may be continued, where there is proper care taken no to mix the different sorts together in the same garden; but the Orange Carrot is generally esteemed in London, where the yellow and the white Carrots are seldom cultivated. The dark red, or purple Carrot, I take to be a distinct sort from either of these; but as it is much tenderer, I have not had an opportunity of seeing it in the flower, for the roots were all destroyed by the first frosts in autumn. The seeds of this sort were sent me from Aleppo, which succeeded very well, the roots were not so large as those of the other sorts of Carrots, and were of a purple colour, very like that of a deep-coloured Radish; they were very tender and sweet; the leaves were finer cut than those of the common Carrot, and were less hairy.</p>
<p align="left">The second sort is commonly cultivated in gardens for the kitchen, and the different varieties of it are, in some places, esteemed, though in London, the Orange Carrot is preferred to all the other. The yellow and the white Carrots are seldom cultivated. The dark red, or purple carrot, I take it to be a different variety from these, but it is much tenderer. The seeds were sent to from Aleppo&nbsp;<i>(largest city in Syria)</i>. They succeeded very well but the roots were not as large as other carrots. They were tender and sweet with finer leaves." (Philip Miller: Gardeners Dictionary. London 1768)<i><font size="2">&nbsp;(source Botanicus.org)</font></i></p>

<p>In 1602 the Dutch government set out to monopolize the intercontinental spice trade, establishing the Dutch East India Company as an official colonial agency. The company was given massive financial backing and the legal power to wage war, create overseas settlements, and uphold its own jurisprudence. For over 200 years the company represented Dutch interests in Asia and dominated European trade.</p>
<p>The surgeon�s chests remained more or less the same throughout that period, consisting of some 130 different �potent/curing� ingredients, from which the surgeon could choose to prepare his prescriptions. It is recorded that in 1784 they were divided into various kinds of plasters (emplastra), ointments (unguenta), oils (olea), opium derivations in the form of pills (opiata in massam pilularum redacta), purgatives (laxativa), roots (radices), honey preparations (mellitta), waters (aquae), marmalades (conservae), powders (pulveres), herbs (herbae), flowers (flores), bark, fruits, woods and seeds (cortices, fructus, ligna, semina), concentrated juices, gums, and resins (succi condensati, gummi, resinae).</p>
<p>The chests also contained ingredients such as mercury, laurel, vinegar, turpentine and juniper, necessary for the preparation of plasters, as well as sulphur, sulphuric acid, anti-diarrhoea preparations, <b><font color="#FF0000">ground carrots</font></b>, barks, and animal parts (like pig�s feet, crab�s eyes, deer antlers, and Spanish fly)</p>

<p><img src="gifs/jefferson.gif" vspace="2" width="148" height="204" align="left" alt="Thomas Jefferson" hspace="5" />Thomas Jefferson &nbsp;(3rd President of the Unites States) raised several types of carrots in his Monticello garden. In 1814 he produced 18 bushels of carrots.. Thomas Jefferson wrote that "the greatest service which can be rendered any country is to add a useful plant to its culture."</p>
<p>The gardens at Monticello were a botanic garden, an experimental laboratory of ornamental and useful plants from around the world. At Monticello, Jefferson cultivated over 250 vegetable varieties in his 1000-foot-long garden terrace and 170 fruit varieties in the eight-acre fruit garden, designed romantic grottos, garden temples, and ornamental groves, and took visitors on rambling surveys of his favourite "pet trees." &nbsp;Jefferson was crazy about gardening.&nbsp; See Jefferson's handwritten note <a target="_blank" href="jeffersonletter1.pdf">here</a> about how he underestimated the amount of carrots he needed.</p>
<p>An interesting letter from George Divers to Thomas Jefferson in 1809 gives an idea of one man's preferences for several of the root crops. "I sow 200 feet each of parsnip and beet. 320 feet each salsafy and carrots�which is a very ample provision for my table and indeed, more than sufficient." Jefferson's Garden Book (first citation) shows:-&nbsp; Carrots (1774), Early Carrot (1812), Large Carrot (1812), Orange Carrot (1809), Yellow Carrot (1811).</p>
<p>He also said "I have lived temperately, eating little animal food, and that not as an aliment, so much as a condiment for the vegetables which constitute my principal diet." (TJ to Dr. Vine Utley, 21 March 1819)</p>
<p>In the book "Eighteen Bushels of Carrots � A rich Spot of Earth � Thomas Jefferson�s Revolutionary Garden at Monticello"&nbsp; Peter J Hatch 2012 states:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<blockquote><i>Carrots (Daucus carota) were an everyday staple in the Monticello vegetable garden, and Jefferson was a determined and dedicated carrot grower, documenting the sowing of seeds some thirty times. Carrot seed was sowed in the retirement garden every spring, sometimes for more than one crop: at least an entire garden square was dedicated solely to carrots in order to fulfill Jefferson's requirement of a ten bushel yearly harvest. In 1814 Jefferson recorded the harvest of eighteen bushels of carrots from two garden squares on November 25, an impressive accomplishment given the garden's heavy clay soil and the long, hot summer the plants were forced to endure. Perhaps Jefferson's success was due to the horticultural expertise of his accomplished neighbour, George Divers. A Garden Book entry from 1809 reads, "G. Divers finds the following sufficient for his family ...</i>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Carrots 320. f =8. do [rows] 12. I. apart." Available from Washington markets ten months of the year, carrots were served with butter sauce in the President's House. Garden-grown carrots were also incorporated into Monticello soups, beef dishes, and porridge. A Jefferson family recipe for "Chartreuse" creatively showcased the colourful Monticello root crops, particularly carrots. According to Jefferson's granddaughter Virginia Randolph Trist, "At Monticello the vegetables, all roots, no cabbage, were cut in slices &amp; arranged in a fanciful way, alternating carrots with white vegetables, in a straight-sided vessel. It turned out in a beautiful form and made a very pretty dish for a ceremonious dinner. The inside was filled up with forced meat balls." Like all root crops, carrots were especially useful because they could be left in the ground all winter until chefs were ready for them, or they could be easily stored in cellars for months at a time.'</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Few vegetables have such an ancient lineage as the carrot. Both the Queen Anne's lace type of European white carrot and the yellow and purple forms native to Afghanistan were described by Greek and Roman authors but evolved for centuries into the smooth, bright orange carrot grown by Jefferson and known to us growers today. Although its origin is disputed, most authorities believe that the orange carrot was a sixteenth-century Dutch innovation, created from yellow and purple West Asian carrots. John Gerard only described the yellow and purple forms, and John Parkinson, while he hinted at the emerging "deep gold yellow" carrot, inferred that orange carrots were still unknown in England in 1629. By 1768, however, Philip Miller would prefer the "esteemed" orange carrot, and he gave exacting directions for its cultivation for a succession of harvests throughout the year. In contrast, John Randolph of Williamsburg preferred the white, "much the sweetest kind." while Orange County's Francis Taylor identified only yellow and white kinds in 1796.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Carrots were introduced into the American colonies with the first settlers and were a common colonial garden staple. Seed was sold by Virginia seed dealers, including the standard variety, Long Orange, and carrots were grown by Jefferson contemporaries like Francis Taylor, William Faris, and John Hartwell Cocke. Taylor mentioned how he collected "wild carrot seed," or Queen Anne's lace, for a friend's wife, probably to sow in a flower garden. While Richard Parkinson described American carrots as "almost tasteless and nothing like those in England," a 1786 edition of Pennsylvania Mercury reported that every family in the state grew carrots. Gardeners such as William Faris sowed twenty rows of carrot seed "at end of onion bed" in April and dug his carrots in March for consuming during the traditional "starving" season of early spring. Jefferson was not particular about carrot varieties. He identified them generically and simply as "early," "large," "orange," and "yellow."</i></p>

<p>Theophrastus, the father of botany used binomials even in the 4th century B.C., but it was Linnaeus who systematized them and made them into a workable code of nomenclature, distinguishing for the first time between species and varieties, and making the species the unit of classification.

<p align="left">A British army manual written in 1798 sang the praises of soup for weary troops. Nothing is so agreeable and at the same time so wholesome to a soldier, after a fatiguing and perhaps wet march, as some warm soup. The use of broth or soup is particularly advantageous after great fatigue, because, on these occasions, the digestive organs are weakened and less liable to bear solid food than at other times. That manual went on to enumerate the items usually available for the army mess�s soup kettle. Among these were cabbage, <b>carrots</b>, parsnips, onion, and potatoes. <i>(The Soldiers Friend 1798)</i></p>
<p>John Wesley gave to the world in <font color="#FF0000">1769</font> an admirable little treatise on <i>Primitive Physic, or an Easy and Natural Method for Curing most Diseases</i>; the medicines on which he chiefly relied being our native plants. For asthma, he advised the sufferer to "<b>live a fortnight on boiled Carrots only</b>"; for "baldness, to wash the head with a decoction of Boxwood"; for "blood-spitting to drink the juice of Nettles".</p>
<p>On the 28th of November, 1771, British explorer Captain James Cook was appointed to the command of the Resolution in which he made his second voyage of discovery to the south Pacific. It was recommended to Captain Cook in 1771 by Baron Storch of Berlin as a cure for scurvy.</p>
<p>He evaporated carrot juice to the thickness of treacle. Following this advice Captain Cook set off to discover the New World in 1772, reaching the Cape of Good hope after a 3 months voyage. The voyage carried amongst its provision some 30 gallons of Carrot Marmalade. Cook�s ship, the Resolution finally docked in New Zealand after 117 days at sea, the good state of the men's health was partly attributed to the ingestion of Carrot Marmalade, to help ward off scurvy. The mammoth journey ended in 1776 with an astonishing record of only one man being lost from sickness and that was not from scurvy! <i><font size="2">(source History of Scurvy Vitamin C, by Ken J Carpenter, 1988)</font></i></p>
<p>On 17 January 1773, Resolution was the first ship to cross the Antarctic Circle.&nbsp; Captain Cook's own account of the voyage includes a section on the provisions he took for the voyage:-</p>
<blockquote><i>We had besides many extra articles, such as malt, sour krout, salted cabbage, portable broth, saloup, mustard, marmalade of carrots, and inspissated juice of wort and beer. Some of these articles had before been found to be highly antiscorbutic; and others were now sent out on trial, or by way of experiment;�the inspissated juice of beer and wort, and <b>marmalade of carrots</b> especially. As several of these antiscorbutic articles are not generally known, a more particular account of them may not be amiss. Marmalade of carrots is the juice of <b>yellow carrots</b>, inspissated till it is of the thickness of fluid honey, or treacle, which last it resembles both in taste and colour. It was recommended by Baron Storsch, of Berlin, as a very great antiscorbutic; but we did not find that it had much of this quality.&nbsp; (Inspissated means evaporated off to make a syrup)</i>The ship took 30 imperial gallons (140 l) of 'Mermalade of Carrots'.</blockquote>

<p>Extract of a letter to Captain Cook, aboard the sloop Resolution at Deptford Dock, from Baron Storsch, written from Berlin 12 September 1771. The letter is in a letter book of orders, correspondence and instructions to and from Cook and the British Admiralty in preparation for his second voyage of discovery.</p>
<p>In the letter Storsch remarks the recipe is �one of the best Remedies against the Scurvy, it will be of the greatest use in long Sea Voyages, and if this Remedy should take it will of consequence improve the Culture of this useful wholesome Root.�</p>
<p>Text of the letter</p>
<blockquote><i>"About the beginning of October when the Yellow Carrots are the Sweetest, you take fresh out of the Ground as many as you intend to make use of. Take care to chose them well, that none with black Spots be left between them.</i>
<p><i>You wash your Carrots sundry times &amp; clean them nicely of the Herb as well as of the Green Top. If you intend to make but a Small quantity of the Marmalade you may grate your Carrots upon a Tin Grater but should you want any large quantity, you may mince or hatch the Carrots which you put into a Kettle And Add as much fresh water, that your Carrots be cover�d with about four inches with Water. You boil them over a Small fire until they are reduced to a pap, the Grated Carrots Want less boiling, the hatched ones must be boil�d about twelve hours, take a great care never to give too Much fire after they begin to boil &amp; to stir your Carrots now &amp; then of fear they may stick and burn beneath.</i></p>
<p><i>When your Carrots are boil�d enough, you must strain them well through a clean linen and press the Felt well, that all the juice may come out, the dregs are a good Food for Hogs, Geese &amp; Ducks. You put the filtrated Juice of Carrots into another Kettle &amp; boil it again over a small fire until it gets the thickness of a fluid honey, at this last boiling you must take great care by constant stirring and by small firing to prevent its sticking to the Kettle &amp; burning, which will give to your Marmalade a bitter and disagreeable taste.</i></p>
<p><i>When your Marmalade is enough boil�d and well done, you preserve it into Stone or Earth pots, well varnish�d &amp; keep it well cover�d with a Parchment or Bladder, if it is well made &amp; thick enough boil�d, it will preserve full two years.</i></p>
<p><i>Should your Marmalade spoil by some accident or other and get some moisture at the top, you take of the moisture with a Spoon and boil it again and it will regain its first sweetness.</i></p>
<p><i>Other method of making the Carrot Marmalade (transcription of above image of letter)</i></p>
<p><i>You squeeze the Juice out of the grated or hatched Carrots and boil it immediately thick without any addition of water either over a Small fire or even over boiling water, you preserve it in the abovementioned way, but it will not keep above a twelve month.</i></p>
<p><i>In some Parts of Germany where many acres of Carrots are cultivated they make use of Oil Mills to squeeze the juice of the Carrots and boil it afterwards in the last mentioned manner.</i></p>
<p><i>One acre of good soil well plowed will want 24 ounces of carrot seeds, a less rich soil will want 2 pound of seed per acre.</i></p>
<p><i>The carrot don�t improve well in a well dung land."</i></p>

<p>In 1773, Captain Cook and navigator Tobias Furneaux planted a number of gardens in Queen Charlotte Sound, New Zealand, with plants such as potatoes, <b>carrots</b>, parsnips, cabbages, onions, leeks, parsley, radish, mustard, broad beans, kidney beans, peas, turnips and wheat. That same year, south of Cape Kidnappers, Cook gave the Māori chief Tuanui roots and seeds, including wheat, beans, peas, cabbages, turnips, onions, carrots, parsnips and yams. When Europeans arrived, Māori replaced their traditional crops with those brought by Europeans. Their main crop was soon potatoes, which provided a heavier and more reliable food source than kūmara, and could be grown throughout the country. Corn, cabbages, tobacco, carrots, turnips, squash, swedes and new varieties of kūmara were also added to Māori gardens.</p>
<p>By the start of the 19th century vegetable growing had become a highly profitable enterprise for some coastal tribes who sold or traded their vegetables with whalers, sealers and the first European settlers.</p>
<p>Although Māori adopted the new crops they did not adopt all European horticultural practices. Māori were reluctant to use hoes and spades, preferring their traditional tools. They also refrained from fertilising their crops with animal manure, instead continuing to clear new sites when the fertility of their gardens dropped.</p>
<p>On 13 May 1787 it was recorded that a total of 66 bushels of seed was loaded aboard HMS Sirius, Supply and Golden Grove, part of the fleet of eleven ships which left Portsmouth, England for Australia. Gidley King's gang of convict gardeners sowed carrot seed at Norfolk Island on 17 March 1788, just two weeks after their arrival. It noted that the seedlings had sprouted by 21 March (probably not correct!). More carrots, from "English Seeds" were sown on 7 July and the mature roots were gathered in October.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In November 1788 recorded in the transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (second volume, part 1) was a report on the distillation of spirits from carrots Mr Hornby and Dr Hutton, conducted in 17 May 1788. Mr Thomas Hornby, druggist from York described the process for producing an ardent spirit from carrots. The experiment concluded that 200 tons of carrots would produce 200 gallons of proof spirit.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This proved to be more expensive than creating spirit from grain (malt, wheat and rye) but the resulting �refuse� could compensate for that cost through its sale for animal feed. It also concluded that the corn could then be better used for other purposes&nbsp; �an object worthy of attention and encouragement�.

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>By the 1800's</b></font> horticultural growers were producing roots of a colossal size. Some were two feet in length with a girth of twelve inches and weighing four pounds each. Carrots were widely cultivated in the walled gardens of country estates. Growers were continually experimenting with strains to create the perfect "show roots". Come the 19th century, carrots were widely grown and began their descent into the ordinary alongside onions and potatoes. This certainly was not a bad thing, as obviously some foodstuffs have to take the role as workhorse recipe ingredients. And carrots certainly do it well, whether it's the leading taste in a soup, cake or refreshing drink, or bit-player in stock, salad or stew.</p>

<p><i>"The purport of this communication is to explain, with a degree of accuracy, the best method to produce carrots.

<p>Having explained in some considerable details (though he describes it as concise!) the document then moves on to <i>describe the use and application of carrots once cultivated.</i> Overgrown and crooked carrots are extracted before the rest go off to market, the former are retained for home consumption "for which they will answer vas well as the others".&nbsp;&nbsp; The ones retained were recommended as an extremely valuable feed to cart horses and other cattle, but not riding horses "n<i>imble exercise causes them to be laxative and produce griping."</i> It is interesting that even at this early stage the market preferred straight carrots.

It also stated -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The produce of an acre of carrots in Suffolk was upwards of 800 bushels per acre, which considerably exceeds the largest crop of potatoes. In comparing thee carrot with the potato an additional circumstance greatly in favour of the former is, that it does not requir to be steamed or boiled , and it is not more difficult to wash that the potato. These and other circumstances considered, it appears to be the most valuable of all roots for working horses. An able Norfolk team horse, fully worked two journeys a day, winter and summer, may be kept the entire year round upon the produce of only one stature acre of land.</p>

The experiment was never repeated and it is thought that the "wild" plants used had previously been hybridised in nature with cultivated carrots. <i>(Source Banga 1957)</i> - Vilmorin's report was named "On the Improvement of the Wild Carrot" . <a href="HortSocLon1842.pdf">Read the full paper here</a></p>
<p align="justify">His partial success had nothing to do with cultivation and everything to do with the wild carrots gene pool that enabled him to fix the genomes he selected. He simply selected seed from biennial, red rooted variations. So he could not lay claim to be the founder of modern carrot, as many writers suggest.</p>
<p align="justify">Vilmorin produced "The Vegetable Garden" in 1856 and it became one of the major resources for botanists and others interested in garden plants.</p>

<p>The value of the sugar content in carrots was becoming more recognised and valued. The Rural Cyclopedia written by Rev John Wilson in 1847 in Edinburgh �Communicates a thorough knowledge of farming, a general knowledge of gardening and a very considerable knowledge of the natural sciences and of general country affairs.� , talked about the creation of an alcoholic spirit from carrots as shown below. Nevertheless the main use for carrots was as animal fodder and particularly recommended as a medicine for horses, given to aid breathlessness, chronic cough, poor skin, to expel wind and given to sick or idle horses in place of corn. "There is none better are perhaps even as good".</p>
<blockquote><i>The culinary uses of carrots for soups, for stews, for haricots, for boiling whole with beef, and for other methods of cookery, are too well known to require any remark. The availableness of carrots for the manufacture of sugar has already been noticed. The expressed juice of carrots, in consequence of the large proportion of sugar it contains, yields, after fermentation, and through the process of distillation, so large a quantity of spirituous liquor as twelve gallons of spirit fro every ton of carrots.</i></blockquote>

<p>By 1849 the seeds catalogues were expanding their range - Early Scarlet Horn Long Orange Fine Surrey Parsnip (!) - Hollow Crown Altringham White (for agricultural) - Catalogue of John Kernan</p>
<p>In 1850 Miss Leslie's "Lady's New Receipt Book" gave a useful guide for small and large families containing directions for cooking, preserving and pickling:</p>
<blockquote><i>TO STEW CARROTS. Half-boil the carrots; then scrape them nicely, and cut them into thick slices. Put them into a stew-pan with as much milk as will barely cover them, a very little salt and pepper, and a sprig or two of chopped parsley. Simmer them till they are perfectly tender, but not broken. When nearly done, add a piece of fresh butter rolled in flour. Send them to table hot. Carrots require long cooking.</i>
<p><i>The common wild-ducks, teal, &amp;c., should always be parboiled with a large carrot in the body to extract the fishy or sedgy taste. On tasting this carrot before it is thrown away, it will be found to have imbibed strongly that disagreeable flavour.</i></p>
<p><i>TO KEEP CARROTS, PARSNIPS, BEETS, AND SWEET POTATOES. These should all be housed before the first frost. Range them side by side, and bury them in dry sand ; a bed of sand at the bottom ; another between each layer of the vegetables, and a thick sand covering for the whole. When wanted for use, begin at one end, and draw them out in regular order, and not out of the middle till you come to it.</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>1861</b> - "The Illustrated London News" on 6 April included an article entitled Carrot Bunching:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In the level land between Kensington and Fulham (London) there is grown in profusion carrots, rhubarb and cabbages. The bunching of carrots which is here depicted commences in autumn, and is carried on in the open fields throughout the winter up to April. They are first gently dug from the earth, washed, and then artistically tied with willow twigs into bunches. The tying is work of great care and importance, as if the bunches are not tastefully got up they do not sell well.</i></p>
<p><i>When a sufficient number of bunches are made ready they are piled with equal care on a light cart, and brought about midnight to Covent Garden, where they are sold, the best to the wholesale dealers and the greengrocers, and the residue to the costermongers. It is a rather a remarkable fact that the carrot is the only vegetable which has no saline ingredient, and hence its peculiar mission as aide-de-camp of boiled beef</i>.

<b>Also in 1861 -</b> saw the publication of Mrs Beeton's "Book of Household Management" arguably the most famous cookery writer in British history. she writes three pages on carrots and carrot recipes, how to boil, dress, stew and&nbsp; slice carrots. she describes their origin,&nbsp; the constituent parts of carrots and advice on how to collect seeds. She said "Several species of carrots are cultivated,�the red, the yellow, and the orange. Those known as the Crecy carrots are considered the best, and are very sweet. The carrot has been classed by hygienists among flatulent vegetables, and as difficult of digestion."&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is how she describes the nutritional value. <a href="beetoncarrots.pdf">Read an extract from Mrs Beeton's cookbook here.

<p><b>New Carrots - "NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES OF THE CARROT - Sir H. Davy<img border="0" src="photos/beeton2.jpg" alt="Mrs Beeton Picture of New Carrots" width="275" height="162" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></b> ascertained the nutritive matter of the carrot to amount to ninety-eight parts in one thousand; of which ninety-five are sugar and three are starch. It is used in winter and spring in the dairy to give colour and flavour to butter; and it is excellent in stews, haricots, soups, and, when boiled whole, with salt beef. In the distillery, owing to the great proportion of sugar in its composition, it yields more spirit than the potato. The usual quantity is twelve gallons per ton."</p>
<p>Sir Humphry Davy ascertained the nutritive matter of Carrots to amount to 98 parts in 1,000, of which 95 are sugar, and three are starch. Weight for weight, they stand third in nourishing value on the list of roots and tubers, potatoes and parsnips taking first and second places. Carrots containing less water and more nourlshing material than green vegetables, have higher nutritive qualities than turnips, swedes, cabbage, sprouts, cauliflower, onions and leeks. Moreover, the fair proportion of sugar contained in their composition adds to their nourishing value.</p>
<p><b>1861 -</b> The Cultivator, monthly journal published in the USA, for the farm and garden dedicated to agricultural and rural improvement, by Luther Tucker &amp; Son reported - <i>"Will it pay to raise carrots for feeding stock, is a q<b><img border="0" src="photos/beeton1.jpg" width="102" height="172" alt="Carrot Image from Mrs Beeton" align="right" /></b>uestion often asked.

I have not failed to raise but once in 12 years, a good crop of roots, mostly carrots, and have found them to pay me better than any crop that I can raise for cattle, sheep and horses. They give very rich milk and improve butter and are a healthy food for all animals"&nbsp; Extract from a Carroty Exhortation - letter published in the journal. <a href="photos/cult1861.jpg">See image of the letter here.</a></i></p>
<p><b>US Civil War (1861-65) -</b> Coffee was by far the most popular beverage in the North and South and the US Army went to great efforts to endure that soldiers always had coffee beans. However in the South coffee became almost nonexistent early in the war and substitutes had to be found, including roasting acorns, corn, dandelion roots and <b>carrot root</b>.&nbsp; None were really satisfactory.&nbsp; One of the most reviled rations were the small cubes of dried carrots, onions, and celery distributed to both armies. Known as desiccated vegetables, these cubes were supposed to provide a reliable and portable source of fibre and vitamins. But the soldiers regarded as little more than bird food, and soon the cubes were called by a new name: �desecrated vegetables.�&nbsp;</p>

It must simmer six hours. Then get two pounds of fillet of veal: stew it, and pour the soup over the meat.

<p align="left">Early French Forcing�The earliest variety, largely grown for forcing purposes; globe shaped root of an orange red color.</p>
<p align="left">Early Scarlet Horn�Best for early planting out of doors. Tops small, coarsely divided; roots top shaped, surface dented, skin orange red.</p>
<p align="left">Ox-Heart�This new carrot conies from France. It is intermediate in length between the half-long varieties and the Short Horn, but much thicker than the latter, attaining at the top 3 or 4 inches in diameter. It is of fine quality for table use, and deserves general cultivation.</p>
<p>Half-Long Scarlet Nantes�Tops medium; roots cylindrical, smooth, bright orange; flesh orange, be- coming yellow in center, but with no distinct core; of the finest quality. This variety is extensively used in France for culinary purposes, and only needs to be known to supersede the coarser sorts for garden culture.</p>
<p align="left">New Chantenay�This new half-long slump-root- ed carrot is one of the most productive varieties known, has an extra large shoulder, is easily dug, and is in every way desirable. It is very smooth, fine in texture, and of a beautiful rich orange color. Well worthy of cultivation.</p>
<p align="left">Danvers Half-Long Orange�A most excellent variety for all soils. It will yield the greatest bulk with smallest length of roots of any variety, 20 to 30 tons being no unusual crop per acre.</p>
<p align="left">Red Saint Vallery�A large, beautiful Carrot, of a rich, deep orange red color. The roots grow very straight and smooth, from ten to twelve inches long. Very fine quality for table use, and very productive.</p>
<p align="left">Large White Belgian� Grows one-third cut of the ground; immense yielder; large size ; easily gathered; very suitable for stock. Improved Long Orange�Long roots, good yielder. Good for table or stock. We offer the best strain of this fine variety.</p>
<p align="left">Giant Victoria�This is the Goliath among the carrot family. Under rich manuring it will grow to be nearly the size of an average mangold wurzel.</p>
