<p><font face="Arial"><img src="gifs/fivefruit.gif" width="137" height="138" alt="five fruits a day" align="left" />What is the secret to permanent weight loss? First, you have to understand what actually causes weight gain.<br />
Most people believe that they gain weight when they eat too much, because of heredity or because of ageing.<br />
Here are the real reasons.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>Nutrient deficiency</i>. Most people eat too much cooked, processed and nutrient deficient food. In fact, Americans are the most overfed and undernourished people in the world! When you eat nutrient-deficient food, your stomach may be full, but your body continues to send out the 'I'm hungry' signal. This can lead to overeating and weight gain.<br />
<br />
<i>Changes in body composition</i>. As people age, they gradually lose lean muscle mass and develop more fat, a process known as sarcopenia. Poor food choices and lack of exercise can accelerate this condition. This is significant because it takes between 25 and 50 calories per day to maintain a pound of lean muscle, whereas it takes only 2 calories per day to maintain a pound of fat. Over time, this means that the body can process fewer and fewer calories, which can lead to weight gain.<br />
<br />
<font color="#FF0000">The formula for losing weight and keeping it off is simple:</font><br />
Focus on food choices rather than counting calories. It is interesting to note that the average person in China consumes 30% more calories and a pound more of food every day than the average American, yet most Chinese people do not have a weight problem. It's because of the types of foods they eat.<br />
<font color="#FF0000"><br />
Eat more nutrient-dense foods.</font> This means consuming a diet rich in fresh raw fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. In fact, the majority of the diet should consist of plant-based food.<br />
<font color="#FF0000">Increase exercise.</font> Exercise elevates the metabolism long after the activity is completed, and helps to burn fat and to build lean muscle mass. A lean body burns more calories while resting than a fat body does!<br />
<font color="#FF0000">Pay attention to the ingredients</font> in the packaged foods you buy. You'll be surprised at how much sugar and other processed ingredients are in some of your favourite foods!<br />
<font color="#FF0000">Buy a new cookbook</font> and try some new recipes and ingredients - learn to make healthier meals at home.<br />
Make sure that your changes are gradual and permanent. Don't start anything today that you can't continue for a lifetime.<br />
<font color="#FF0000">Eat more carrots</font> - here's how.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Eat more carrots and reduce and maintain your weight easily. Is it possible that consistent moderate weight loss could reliably result from a diet as simple as eating more carrots? Yes! &nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Irena Chalmers</font> in "The Great Food Almanac" said eating a carrot a day is "like signing a life insurance policy,".</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The basic rule of this diet is to add a carrot (varied with other low calorie "rabbit-food") at or near the beginning of every meal. Why should this work? This works because a bulky carrot at or near the meal's beginning leaves no room in the stomach at the meal's end for the extra ice-cream or cheesecake. That saves perhaps 500 calories a day, which translates to a weight loss of about a pound a week.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The same result could be obtained by consuming any other low-calorie vegetable, singly or in combination: radishes, cucumbers, turnips, jicama <i>(A mexican fruit a cross between an apple and sweet potato)</i>, zucchini, tomatoes, celery, mushrooms, dill pickles, etc. Low-calorie vegetable juices from your own juicer or from the market would also produce the same results. Even plain water at the beginning of a meal will tend to create a full feeling in the stomach sooner in the meal. This will reduce the amount of food consumed at the end. But eating carrot is more fun.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This add-a-carrot diet will not work if psychological problems, lack of exercise or addictive food allergies cause your overweight difficulties. It is likely to be effective if your extra pounds are primarily the result of poor habits.You have nothing to lose, however, from the attempt at such a diet. An added benefit is that this diet can help to change your eating patterns in the direction of lower-fat, higher-fibre food items. Most overweight people have high-fat eating patterns that need changing no matter what else causes their overweight conditions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Good health and exercise does not come from a capsule. Exercise is essential for good health and a healthier life. Exercise helps you lose weight by burning fat and increasing muscle tissue. It also increases your metabolic rate and energy level, improves digestion and sleep, lowers blood pressure, improves cholesterol levels, increases mental alertness, strengthens muscles and bones, increases flexibility, improves stamina, reduces depression and improves self-esteem.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Studies show that just 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day can:<br />
� Cut your risk of heart disease by 50%<br />
� Reduce your risk of hypertension, diabetes and colon cancer by 30%<br />
� If you're overweight, cause you to lose an extra 14 lbs (on average) this year without any other changes in your diet and lifestyle.<br /></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">So what is a healthy diet?<br />
What is a healthy diet? Most people don't know, not because they're ignorant or don't care - it's because they're confused. There is so much conflicting advice about diet and nutrition, who can blame us when we throw in the towel and eat pizza? You may hear much conflicting advice and confusing information, but actually, hidden away among the self-serving propaganda of a lot of the food industry there are very clear guidelines for healthy eating. After years of research and campaigning, there are finally official and nutritionally sound guidelines for a good diet.</font></p>
