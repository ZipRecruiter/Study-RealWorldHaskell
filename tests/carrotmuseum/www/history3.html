Art works alone are not considered to be good enough evidence of true colours as the paint colours used are not always true to type, and artists use colour effects in arranging their subjects. So in paintings, the differences between yellow and orange roots could be due to artistic features rather than to differences between cultivars. One can probably say with certainty that orange varieties were grown in the Netherlands at this time but this does not prove their origin in that locality. <i>(Brandenberg) (<a href="history5.html#art%20works">examples of art works here</a>)</i>
<p>In the late 1500s, agricultural scientists in the Netherlands bred selected deep yellow carrots together to make stable, large, straight, sweet, orange carrots like the ones we eat today, possibly because they thought the fad for sweet oranges would make people like other orange foods. But people still mostly fed carrots to horses and donkeys and pigs, and didn�t eat them themselves.</p>
<p>Dutch immigrants arriving in England from the middle of the sixteenth established communities, mostly in towns in southern and eastern England. Many were textile workers but vegetable gardeners and farmers also came, introducing the crops and intensive techniques of their native lands.</p>
<p>Immigrant gardeners made a significant contribution to food production at Norwich, Sandwich, and Colchester before the end of the sixteenth century. At Norwich in 1575 the Strangers' production of vegetables was 'grete succor and sustenaunce for the pore'. The vicar of St Clements, Sandwich, took tithe of Dutchmen's gardens from 1570. Some Strangers moved from Sandwich to Colchester; by I584 over 1000 Dutch people lived there and gardeners amongst them produced root vegetables for sale. <i><font size="2">(source - L F Roker, 'The Flemish and Dutch Community in Colchester in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries', M A London Univ, 1963. p 84, State Papers Domestic, Elizabeth, vol 2o, no 49; William Boys, Collections for an History of Sandwich, Canterbury, ~792, p 340)</font></i></p>
<p>There is quite a lot more information about the influence of Dutch agriculturists and their role in Sandwich in <font face="Arial"><i> <font size="3">Garden seeds in England before the late eighteenth century: I.

<hr />
<p>It is important to note that the first documentary record of the use of "orange" as a colour name in English was in 1512, in a will now filed with the Public Record Office. Before this word was introduced to the English-speaking world, the colour was referred to as ġeolurēad (yellow-red). <i><font size="2">(Source: Oxford English Dictionary,2011.)</font></i> <font face="Arial">Therefore documentary references to orange carrot are virtually non-existent around this time. One could argue that when writers were referring to light red or deep yellow they could easily have meant orange, as there was no word for it!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#000000">The 16th Century witnessed the</font> use of carrots as flavourings for meat dishes, rather than a main vegetable. The herbalist Gerard noted that the yellow carrot has a mild flavour. (see more about the references to carrots - <i><a href="herbalists.html">(Carrots in Herbals/Herbalists here</a> <a href="manuscripts.html">&nbsp;- Ancient Manuscripts page here)</a></i> .&nbsp; Root crops were not really grown in open fields until after the end of the 16<sup>th</sup> C although carrot, parsnip and skirrets had been familiar long before, evidence by several mentions in gardening and recipe cook books to �herbes for potage� and �herbes for salad�. Growing on any sort of scale was limited to the gardens of castles and monasteries. Much of the time they were mainly grown for the animals they kept rather than feed the people.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Gentlemen in their country house cajoled or bullied their tenants to supply them with novel luxuries such as they had enjoyed on their visits to London, with the result that many peasants grew carrots for sale at a very early date. It is recorded that many new vegetables were tithed � a sure sign that they were for sale and not just for household use. The date of 1614 is recorded as the time in Kirkby Malzeard, Yorkshire when artichokes, parsnips carrots and turnips were tithed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Nearly all the botanists and writers on gardening, all over Europe, were familiar with the carrot and were describing many kinds, including red and purple kinds in France and yellow and red kinds in England. <font color="#000000">Daucus</font> came to be the official name in the sixteenth century, and was adopted by Linnaeus in the eighteenth century. It is thought that for the first few hundred years of its managed cultivation, carrot roots were predominantly purple.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">So little were vegetables cultivated, or gardening understood as yet, that in the year 1509, Henry the 8th's Queen Catharine could not procure a "sallad", till Henry sent to the Netherlands (Holland/Flanders), and engaged a gardener to come over to raise the proper articles here. <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">There is noted an entry in the household book of Cliffords, originally kept in Skipton Castle, a sum of eleven shillings �for six cabbages and some caret roots bought at Hull�. These were then imported from Flanders, whence Queen Catherine had her salads. It was not until the end of Henry's reign that vegetables such as carrots and turnips were available and used by the masses.</span> <font size="2"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">(Reference - History of Great Britain, D Hume, 1832)</span></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At a date probably soon after 1525 an alphabetical list of herbs 'necessary for a garden' was compiled for Thomas Fromond, a Surrey landowner who died in 1543. The list is followed by groups of plants classified for specific purposes and by further collections of species destined for a sophisticated pleasure garden. The form of the list follows a new fashion, and the choice of plants indicates fresh developments in gardening, in line with the changed outlook of the Renaissance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In an agricultural treatise printed in 1569 Agostino Gallo listed what were the then common garden vegetables. These were grown for their usefulness and health-giving properties, which Gallo also details. They were cabbages, leeks, garlic, onions, fennel, <b>carrots</b>, squashes, turnips, radishes, peas, shallots, erba sana (all-good, a kind of wild spinach), artichokes and asparagus.</font></p>

<p><b>Did the Dutch "Invent" Orange Carrots to honour the House of Orange?</b></p>
<p>Red and yellow carrots started to appear in Europe in the 13th century and it is now known, from modern genetic research, that orange carrots were developed from those yellow varieties. In the late 1500s, agricultural scientists in the Netherlands bred selected deep yellow carrots together to make stable, large, straight, sweet, orange carrots like the ones we eat today, possibly because they thought the fad for sweet oranges would make people like other orange foods. But people still mostly fed carrots to horses and donkeys and pigs, and didn�t eat them themselves.</p>
<p>From the middle of the 16th century various carrot colours started to appear in art works, principally from the Dutch and Flemish regions, with paintings depicting market and kitchen scenes and including orange and other carrot colours.</p>
<p>So it is regularly assumed by scholars that it was the Dutch who developed the orange carrot, as we now know from yellow varieties. As we now know from modern genetics it would take several decades to stabilise a new plant variety.</p>
<p>There is no documentary evidence that the Dutch "invented" orange carrots to honour the Royal Family, the House of orange. A tale, probably apocryphal, has it that the orange carrot was bred in the Netherlands in the sixteenth century to honour William of Orange. Though the development and stabilisation of the orange carrot root does appear to date from around that period in the Netherlands, it is unlikely that honouring William of Orange had anything to do with it!</p>
<p>As far as The Carrot Museum is concerned the Dutch developed and stabilised the orange carrot, in the 16th century. Subsequently the Dutch people adopted the colour orange and adopted orange carrots as their national vegetable. There is no written evidence that this was also to honour their Royal Family .The point is that the orange carrot came first, Dutch Nationalism second.</p>
<p>To this day, many in the Netherlands genuinely like to believe that orange carrots were originally grown specifically as a tribute to the House of Orange. No matter how many times it is repeated and passed on through the generations it still remains pure folklore!!</p>
<p>There is still some evidence that orange rooted carrots were around long before. For instance a depiction in an ad 512 manuscript. - <a href="#orange">see here</a></p>

From the middle of the 16th century carrots started to appear in art works, principally from the Dutch and Flemish regions, with paintings depicting market and kitchen scenes and including various carrots colours.&nbsp; Many examples appear on the art pages in the World Carrot Museum, <a href="art1.html">starting here</a>.

<p><font face="Arial">By the Elizabethan period large quantities of vegetables were raised in the increasing numbers of market gardens especially around large towns such as London, Norwich and Worcester. Some concentrated on cheap, high-yielding crops for the poor: parsnips, <b>carrots</b>, turnips and cabbages, once the fashionable food of the rich now became a mainstream staple.&nbsp; According to Hales History of Agriculture by dates (1915)&nbsp; "Salads, carrots and other edible roots were first produced in <b><font color="#FF0000">England in 1530</font></b>."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Both carrots and skirrets were eaten as individual vegetables rather than simply mixed into soup. Carrots were �roasted in the embers til they be tender� then pared and eaten with vinegar and oil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">William Rhind wrote in the "History of the Vegetable Kingdom", 1857 - "Carrot was first generally cultivated in England in the reign of Queen Elizabeth 1 (1533-1603), being introduced by the Flemings, who took refuge from the persecutions of Philip II of Spain, and who, finding the soil about Sandwich peculiarly favourable for it, grew it there largely. The English whose agricultural knowledge which was circumscribed, were in this case well pleased to add another edible vegetable to the scanty list which were then under cultivation. The carrot grew quickly into esteem and, being made an object of careful culture, was very shortly naturalised throughout the land. Parkinson, the celebrated botanist to James the First, mentions that in his time the ladies adorned their head dresses with carrot leaves, the light feathery verdure of which caused then to be no contemptible substitute for the plumage f birds. Although the taste of the fair sex in the present day had discarded this simple and perishable ornament, the leaves of the carrot are even now sometimes used as house decorations."</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Leonhard Rauwolf (also spelled Leonhart Rauwolff) (21 June 1535 � 15 September 1596) was a German physician, botanist, and traveller. His main notability arises from a trip he made through the Levant and Mesopotamia in 1573-75. The motive of the trip was to search for herbal medicine supplies. Shortly after he returned, he published a set of new botanical descriptions with an herbarium. Later he published a general travel narrative about his visit. Both the yellow and the red carrot was seen by Rauwolf growing in Aleppo, the largest City in Syria and again in Tripoli in Lebanon.</font></p>

They were cabbages, leeks, garlic, onions, fennel, carrots, squashes, turnips, radishes, peas, shallots, erba sana (all-good, a kind of wild spinach), artichokes and asparagus. <i>(Gallo, A.

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>1599</b></font> - In his book <i itxtvisited="1">Profitable Instructions for the Manuring, Sowing and Planting of Kitchen Gardens</i>, Richard Gardner wrote: "Sow carrots in your gardens and humbly praise God for them, as for a singular and great blessing."&nbsp; Seed selling was just starting to take place at this time.&nbsp; Richard Gardiner who included a price list in his I599 pamphlet on vegetable and seed growing, offering vegetable seeds retail and also wholesale - 'if any person desire to buy any store of principall carret seedes . . . to sell for reason to others, to benefit the commonwealth, I am willing to serve his turne better cheape then before is declared.'</p>
<p>This was the first printed book dedicated to growing vegetables and urged that more carrots should be grown, because �forraine nations� like Holland were reaping the benefit from their lucrative export trade. This was the only book before 1773 to give detailed instructions on raising seed on a commercial scale.&nbsp; Mr Gardiner was a draper from Shrewsbury and saved the lives of many poor people during a famine by supplying them with carrots. He considered that the �large yellow Carret and the great shorte yellow Carret were the best and fairest rootes� then grown in his native County of Salop (ShropshireUK).</p>
<p>Richard Gardiner's 'Profitable Instructions' of 1599 gives a detailed description of vegetable seed Growing which is particularly valuable because of its early date, is. The book was written by a philanthropic market gardener and textile merchant of Shrewsbury in an effort to encourage kitchen gardening and seed growing. In the passage quoted below Gardiner guides the reader through carrot seed production. Having selected the best carrots from the main crop in September and transplanted them, well spaced, to new beds:</p>
<blockquote><i>"Then have you nothing to doe with them untill about the last of Aprill, at which time they will bee growne about a yard in height: then you have need to take care of them, for the winde will easily breake them by the ground: then must you prepare some kinde of packe-threed, or lynen threed to set about them as a girdle, about two foote high from the earth as neede shall require by the growing of the branches: gird some higher then other some.</i>
<p><i>Then shortly after you must have stakes in a readines, and as the Carrets must stand one against the other in the bed: so likewise the stakes must stand one against the other, to everye foure Carrets two stakes. The stakes must bee a yard and a half above thc ground, and a sure holde within the earth for danger ofwinde: then must you prepare packe-threed or other threed to goe from stake to stakc all the length of thc bed, one course of lyrics must be about two foote high, and another course of lynes must bee neere the top of the stakes, so that there must be two courses of lynes on the utter side of the stakes on both sides the bed.</i></p>
<p><i>Then must you have crosse lynes . . . . as the Carrets branches doc grow they must be somewhat tended to keepe them in good order within the lynes: this being done about the last of August, the Carret seedes will begin to bee ripe, and as they doe change to some browne colour, so to bee cut from time to time, untill the last bee sufficiently ripe about the first of October: Then place the Carret seedes as you doe cut them on a Chamber floore to drie, &amp; when they be drie, beate the secdes out with small staves, or best with tbe edge of a lath, and cleanse them from the composte or refuse (as you finde best by experience) with ridle and sive."</i></p>
<p>Further on in this work he talks about the storage of Carrets (carrots):</p>
<p><i>"In the two months of October and November, when you have leisure in drie weather, then provide a vessel or wine caske, or some other: then lay on course of sand on the bottome of the vessel two inches thicke, then a course of carret rootes, so that the rootes do not touch one another: then another course of sand to cover those rootes, and then another course of sand, and in this manner untill the vessell bee full to the top, and if you have a ground seller, you may packe them in some corner in this manner, you must cut away all the branches of the carrets close by the roote, and somewhat of the small endes of the Carrets, and they must be so packed in sand unwashed and about the last of December: sometime when there is no frost, you must then unpacke them againe, and then the carret rootes will begin to spring in the top of the roote, then if you desire to keepe them untill a longer time, then you must pare off the upper ende of the roote, that they cannot spring any more in the top, and then packe them again in sande as aforesaid, so you may keepe them well till Lent or Easter.� <font size="2">&nbsp;(Source - Garden seeds in England before the late eighteenth century: I.

<p>These pageants or triumphs have, like their predecessors, the mysteries, their relation to the English drama; not only were they composed for the purpose of flattering and complimenting their princes, but a moral end was constantly kept in view: virtue was applauded, while vice was set forth in its most revolting and unpleasing colours; and the altercations between these two leading personages often afforded the populace the highest amusement.</p>
<p>The opportunity was also seized upon of presenting to royal ears some of the political abuses of the day; as in one offered by the Inns of Court to Charles the First, where ridicule was thrown upon the vexatious law of patents: a fellow appearing with a bunch of <b>carrots</b> on his head, and a capon on his fist, and asking for a patent of monopoly as the first inventor of the art of feeding capons with carrots, and that none but himself should have privilege of the said invention for fourteen years; whilst another came mounted on a little horse with an immense bit in his mouth, and the request that none should be allowed to ride unless they purchased his bits.</p>

<p>A tale, probably apocryphal, has it that the orange carrot was bred in the Netherlands in the sixteenth century to honour William of Orange. Though the stabilised orange carrot does date from around this period in the Netherlands, it is unlikely that honouring William of Orange had anything to do with it!&nbsp; It is said, (without much historical reference) that the orange carrot was developed in Holland as a tribute to William I of Orange during the Dutch fight for independence from Spain in the 16th century. The orange carrot, not only had a better taste, did not leech its colour into cookware,&nbsp; but also had beta carotene making it healthier, and so all other carrots stopped being planted.&nbsp; Some astute historian managed to install the myth that the work on an unusual yelllow variety was developed especially to thank William of Orange for achieving independence from Spain.<img src="photos/wild2.JPG" width="288" height="283" alt="Wild Carrot alongside domesticated" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="8" /> Not true!</p>
<p>It is considered that Dutch growers developed the vegetable by selective breeding, probably from a natural yellow variety, to make it less bitter,&nbsp;and then it was adopted it as the Royal vegetable in honour of the House of Orange.&nbsp; The King at the time was William of Orange (1533-84), also known as William the Silent who led the revolt to gain independence from Spain.</p>
<p>Carrots were originally purple, with a thin root. It is commonly reported (without documentary evidence) that the cultivated domestic orange variety did not appear in writings or illustrations until the 1500's when it is thought Dutch agricultural scientists and growers used a mutant yellow carrot seed, perhaps from North Africa to develop a carrot in the colour of the House of Orange, the Dutch Royal Family.<br />
It has been suggested by some historians that In an attempt to "nationalize" the country's favourite vegetable they began experiments on improving the pale yellow versions by cross breeding them with other varieties and wild forms.&nbsp; These varieties contain beta carotene to produce orange-coloured roots.&nbsp; There is no documentary evidence for this.</p>
<p><b>It is more likely</b> that Dutch horticulturists actually found a deep yellow rooted variety and then worked on its development through selective breeding to make the plant consistent.&nbsp; Through successive hybridisation the orange colour intensified. This was developed to become the dominant species across the world - a wonderful, sweet orange, also appearing with different root shapes and respective sizes.</p>
<p>The myth that the Dutch "invented"&nbsp; the orange carrot is a romantic tale, difficult to substantiate&nbsp;in the light of the appearance of an illustration of a mutant/hybrid orange variety (shown below) existing in ad 512, long before the current orange variety developed by the Dutch, and the lack of any other documentary evidence .&nbsp;There is also an 11th century manuscript shows an illustration of an orange rooted carrot. (A more detailed, academic discussion on the origins of the orange carrot is given in a <a href="history5.html">separate museum page here</a>.)&nbsp; Also several more very early illustrations from illuminated manuscripts show orange rooted carrots - <a target="_blank" href="manuscripts.html">separate museum page here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>In 1682 Nehemiah Grew presented in a series of lectures to the Royal Society (UK) on the anatomy of plants with an idea of a philosophical history of plants,&nbsp; wherein he referred to carrots with red and yellow roots with a sweetish taste and that when left in the open air, carrots become a reddish yellow (orange?).</p>
<p>The first recorded use of orange as a colour name in English was in 1512, in a will now filed with the Public Record Office. Before this word was introduced to the English-speaking world, the colour was referred to as ġeolurēad (yellow-red). <font size="2"><i>(Source: Oxford English Dictionary,2011.)</i></font> So it is quite possible that orange carrot did exist in the late 1400's but that there was no word in existence to describe them accurately.</p>
<p><b>One of the first written evidences</b> of an orange carrot, particularly written in English (and therefore cannot be misinterpreted during translation) is Hortus Medicus Edinburgensis � A Catalogue of plants in the Physical Garden at Edinburgh by James Sutherland intendent of said garden in 1683.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another reference appears in 1683 - John Reid's "Scots Gard'ner" <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.org/stream/scotsgardnertoge00reidrich/scotsgardnertoge00reidrich_djvu.txt">full text here</a>. <i>"orenge carrot".</i> &nbsp;Reid also refers to <i>"Of currans, the great red-Dutch, the white-Dutch, the great black."&nbsp;</i> Currans is the old Gaelic name for carrots. <i>"Beetraves, parsneeps, carrots, are very good served up whole, or sliced about meat, also turneeps, with fat broth poured thereon."</i></p>

<p>There is one compelling argument for a much earlier, near eastern origin in the&nbsp;Byzantine illustration in the Dioscorides codex, drawn in 512 ad which shows a carrot plant with a thick, orange coloured root, indicating that carotene cultivars already existed at that time. (photo left below, click to view a larger version). In fact it is considered very likely that this Vienna Codex was copied from a much earlier manuscript, perhaps an illustrated manuscript owned by Theodosius II.(408-450 A.D.)</p>

<p>Whatever the origins, the Long Orange Dutch cultivar, is commonly held to be the progenitor of the orange Horn carrot varieties (Early Scarlet Horn, Early Half Long, Late Half Long). All modern, western carotene varieties ultimately descend from these varieties. The Horn Carrot derives from the Netherlands town of Hoorn in the neighbourhood of which it was probably developed. Horenshce Wortelen (carrots of Hoorn) were common on the Amsterdam market in 1610.&nbsp; The earliest English seedsmen list Early Horn and Long Orange varieties.</p>

The vegetable was a firm favourite of Queen Elizabeth 1 of England. It seems royalty really got the ball rolling when a deputy to the English court presented Queen Elizabeth I with a tub of butter and a wreath of tender carrots emblazoned with diamonds. Lore has it that she removed the diamonds and sent the carrots and butter to the kitchen. They returned as the classic side dish: buttered carrots.</p>
<p>Carrots were slowly accepted for culinary usage during Elizabethan times. The yellow varieties were more popular as the purple strains turned brown and mushy when cooked.</p>
<p>This recipe for Carrot Sauce appears in 1570 in the&nbsp; cookbook "Opera dell'arte del cucinare" by&nbsp; Bartolomeo Scappi a famous Renaissance chef. The first known fact in his life is April 1536, when he organized a banquet while he was in the service of Cardinal Lorenzo Campeggio. He served several other cardinals after this, then began to serve pope Pius IV, entering the service of the Vatican kitchen. He continued to work as a chef for the pope Pius V&nbsp; He acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance cuisine and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a fork.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">In 1598,</font> Juan de O�ate, descendant of a wealthy mining family in Zacatecas, Mexico, won the contract to settle New Mexico. O�ate's expedition was a fully fledged colonising enterprise, and the introduction of new animals and plants was an important part of the plan. &nbsp;Various accounts credit O�ate with the introduction to Mexico of carrots (amongst other vegetables and a variety of herbs and spices). By the 1600's carrots along with cabbages, onions, and garlic were growing on many of the Caribbean&nbsp; islands.&nbsp; It was even found growing on an island off the coast of Venezuela when it was discovered in 1565.</p>
<p>In 1602 Holland they banned plums, spinach and cucumbers and it wasn�t allowed to preserve (keep) the leaves of carrots and radishes, �because it was understood that the infection is most attached thereto.� Quote comes from renowned historian Jan Wagenaar (Amsterdam 1709-1773)</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>17th Century</b></font> - Both yellow and purple varieties were grown in Europe until the 17th century. As vegetables were at that time rather scarce in England, the Carrot's delicious root was warmly welcomed and became a general favourite, its cultivation spreading over the country. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 1600's, in England, carrots were common enough to be grown as a farm crop as well as in small garden plots and mentioned in several written works. The chronology of garden seed growing from the seventeenth century&nbsp; showed specialization and innovation in garden seeds first appearing first at Sandwich. Low Countries' gardeners who settled there from the middle of the sixteenth century developed local strains of beans, peas, radish, and carrot, some of which were sent to London as seeds along with other garden seeds. Just when the area began to send seeds to London is difficult to determine but production was under way early in the seventeenth century. The Sandwich Carrot was recognized for its excellence in 1610, and in the 1630's large quantities of peas and beans were grown there by the Dutch, possibly for seed.</p>
<p>This century saw improved strains resulting in three main varieties, the yellow, red and deep gold. During this time carrots slowly gained acceptance as a vegetable to accompany boiled beef. Carrots were assumed to have aphrodisiac qualities.</p>
<p><img src="gifs/carothat1.gif" width="118" height="118" alt="Picture showing carrot leaves in a hat" align="right" /><font color="#FF0000">In the reign of James I</font>, (1603)&nbsp; it became the fashion for ladies to use flowers, fruit, feathers and the like to decorate their clothes. This was amusingly extended to the use of Wild Carrot flowers and its feathery leaves and stalks to decorate their hair, hats, sleeves, dresses and coats. The lacy green foliage&nbsp; was especially fashionable during the autumn months when the leaves took on a reddish colouration.&nbsp;&nbsp; "the light feathery verdure of which caused them to be no contemptible substitute for the plumage of birds."</p>
<p>Parkinson, the celebrated botanist to King James mentions "that in his day, ladies wore carrot leaves in place of feathers. In winter, an elegant chimney ornament is sometimes formed, by cutting off a section from the head or thick end of a carrot, containing the bud, and placing it in a shallow vessel with water. Young and delicate leaves unfold themselves, forming a radiated tuft, of a very handsome appearance, and heightened by contrast with the season of the year."</p>
<p>The term Victory Garden was nothing new - In 1603 Richard Gardner wrote Victory Garden - "If any citie or &nbsp;towne should be besieged with the enemy <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;</span> what better provision for the greatest number of people &nbsp;can be than every garden be sufficiently planted with carrots�</p>
<p>1607 saw the publication of Sir John Norden�s Surveyor�s Dialogue. Norden�s work contains many judicious observations on the �different natures of grounds, how they may be employed, how they may be bettered, reformed and amended.�</p>
<p>The famous meadows near Salisbury are mentioned, where, when cattle have fed their fill, hogs, it is said, �are made fat with the remnant�namely, with the knots and sappe of the grasse.� �Clover grasse, or the grasse honey suckle� (white clover), is directed to be sown with other hay seeds. <b>�Carrot rootes�</b> were then raised in several parts of England, and sometimes by farmers.</p>
<p>1609 - It was grown by the struggling colonists of the first permanent English settlement in the New World, at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1609. They planted cucumbers at the same time. <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">English carrots were first to be introduced into the colonies accompanying colonists to Jamestown in 1609. and early Pilgrims to Massachusetts no later than 1629 where they �grew bigger and sweeter� than anything found in England. Dutch Mennonites brought orange and scarlet carrots with them into Pennsylvania, from whence they slowly spread through the rest of the colonies.&nbsp; Strictly the settlement was actually 1607.</span></p>
<p>Giacomo Castelvetro writes in The Fruits, Herbs &amp; Vegetables of Italy (1614): �We prepare salads from pink and yellow carrots, roasted or boiled in the same way, and turnips as well."</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">In 1615</font> John Murrell wrote&nbsp; "A new booke of Cookerie; London " which included several recipes requiring carrot root - To boyle the common way; To boyle a Rabbet with Claret Wine; and Giblets with Hearbes, and Rootes <i>(shown below with other recipes)</i>.&nbsp; Many sallets (salads) in the17th century are boiled�.some into dishes that seem familiar now, but we just don�t call them salads, we just call them �vegetables� or �side dishes� or just �sides�.</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Ladie Borlase�s Receiptes Booke</b>, an English manorial and culinary manuscript, has been in existence for over 300 years. This manuscript, bearing dates from 1665 to 1822, provides a unique compendium of culinary history that opens a window to the aristocratic, social, agricultural, horticultural, economic, and medicinal aspects of English country life. The Borlase manuscript is a kind of miscellany. Included are recipes not only for all kinds of foods but also for distilled waters, remedies, dyes, soaps, and perfumes. A housewife of that period was responsible for keeping her family healthy and her house clean and sweet smelling, and so the manuscript features directions for preparing <i>medicinal oyles, waters, glysters ,powders,ballsoms, a true Majistery ,and a julep, with healing powers for a number of ailments from apoplexy and gout to cancer and the plague</i>. The cookery recipes concentrate almost entirely on sweets and meats with only a few mentions of vegetables.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">One of the most powerful reasons that vegetable consumption grew at this time was the effect of published cookery and household management books that told people of some wealth "what they should be wearing, sitting on, hanging on the wall, planting in the garden ... what they should eat and how it must be prepared and planted." These books not only taught people about proper food presentations, they also rescued a number of poor people's vegetables and made them viable for any upper-class home. Examples of these <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">types of lower-class vegetables are the root vegetables: carrots, turnips, parsnips, and beets.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Taking a poor person's vegetable and preparing it in a French fashion would certainly enhance its reputation. Still, <b>carrots</b> and other root vegetables (and not the expensive out-of-season vegetables so desired by the gentry) would be important staples in keeping the poor fed. Even into the middle years of the eighteenth century, a distinguished gardener noted that carrots "provided great comfort to the poor." </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Nicholas Culpeper (1653)</b> said of carrots that "Wild carrots belong to Mercury, and expel wind and remove stitches in the side, promote the flow of urine and women's courses, and break and expel the stone; the seed has the same effect and is good for dropsy, and those whose bowels are swollen with wind: It cures colic, stone, and rising of the mother; being taken in wine or boiled in wine and taken, it helpeth conception. The leaves being applied with honey to running sores or ulcers cleanse them; I suppose the seeds of them perform this better than the roots: and though Galen recommended garden carrots highly to expel wind, yet they breed it first, and we may thank nature for expelling it, not they; for the seeds of them expel wind and so mend what the root marreth."<br />

<p>During the English Civil War a soldier of Cromwell's named Valentine Greatrakes&nbsp; entered the service of the Parliament; but, on the Restoration, being thrown on his own resources, he found himself inspired from Heaven to effect cures by prayer and touching; but soon advanced to all other infirmities.</p>

However his was dismissed as a "quack" doctor, partly because the cure of that ailment was reserved for the touch of Royalty! He claimed to cures many conditions by the laying of hands and was classed as a charlatan, even though the carrot poultice probably worked!</p>
<p>1669 witnessed the publication of the "Closet Opened of Sir Kenelme Digby", <i>"with excellent directions for cookery"</i> including several recipes with carrots - metheglin (mead), pottage, hotchpot and a broth <i>for sick and convalescent persons.</i> This delicious book comes with a witty introduction, a glossary, several useful appendices, including biographical sketches of the aristocratic contributors, and some modernised versions of Sir Kenelme's more accessible recipes.</p>
<p>There can be no better way to get inside the skin of a seventeenth century gentleman, to feel at first hand the "rawness and indigence of the stomach", the pains of "Gravel", stone, and "colick" and the virtue of fierce herbs coursing through the veins. Sir Kenelme was very much interested in the medicinal side of cooking. The sudden death of his wife Venetia was put down to the drinking of "Viper wine" and one can only suppose that this was one of his less successful recipes!!</p>

<p>From the 1670's&nbsp; seedsmen commonly gave away free with each order of these seeds, a 'paper of directions' giving brief instructions on cultivation. It is reasonable to suppose that some gentlemen first came into contact with these field crops by going to a seedsman for garden seeds or receiving by post a new edition of a catalogue. The printed directions bolstered the confidence of uncertain innovators and, like trade cards and other printed ephemera produced by seedsmen, advertised the business.</p>
<p>Some garden vegetables were tried in fields for animal fodder. The turnip was the most successful of these transplants, shifting in men's minds in the first half of the eighteenth century from a garden to a field crop. Carrots and cabbages followed the turnip more cautiously into the fields aided, no doubt, by the availability of seeds and advice from seedsmen.<a href="digbyrecipes.html">&nbsp; See the full details of Mr Digby and his recipes here.</a></p>

<p>An anonymous English Herbal of 1690 had this to say:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="photos/anon1690.jpg" width="825" height="306" /></p>
<p>John Evelyn (1620-1706), an English virtuoso and writer, was a pivotal figure in seventeenth-century intellectual life in England. He left an immensely rich literary heritage, which is of great significance for scholars interested in garden history and the histories of intellectual life and architecture. Evelyn thought the yellow carrots to be the most nutritious. Roots were also used to feed livestock and it was reputed that cattle fed on carrots produced a superior quality milk. This was later found to be just the opposite as the feeding of too many carrots leads to a bitter milk! <font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>We know it was the opinion of James II's head gardener that there should be at least thirty-five ingredients in an ordinary salad. Many roots were included, such as the elecampane, daisy, fennel, angelica, rampion, parsnip, <b>carrot</b>, and they were frequently blanched or candied, or simply boiled and added when cold or pickled. <font face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Arial"><i>(From Garden of Herbs 1921 - Eleanour Rohde)</i></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">In 1699</font> John Evelyn published "Acetaria: A Discourse of Sallets", a book of directions for gardening and cooking. He was famous for his "Diary" and was a friend and contemporary of Samuel Pepys. Both were conscientious public servants who had held minor offices in the government. But, while Pepys' diary is sparkling and redolent of the free manners of the Restoration, Evelyn's is the record of a sober, scholarly man. His mind turned to gardens, sculpture and architecture, rather than to the gaieties of contemporary social life.&nbsp; Here's what the work told us about carrots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>13. Carrots, Dauci, or Pastinaca Sativa; temperately warm and dry, Spicy; the best are yellow, very nourishing; let them be rais'd in Ground naturally rich, but not too heavy.</i></p>
<p><i>26. Pudding of Carrot. Pare off some of the Crust of Manchet-Bread, and grate of half as much of the rest as there is of the Root, which must also be grated: Then take half a Pint of fresh Cream or New Milk, half a Pound of fresh Butter, six new laid Eggs (taking out three of the Whites) mash and mingle them well with the Cream and Butter: Then put in the grated Bread and Carrot, with near half a Pound of Sugar; and a little Salt; some grated Nutmeg and beaten Spice; and pour all into a convenient Dish or Pan, butter'd, to keep the Ingredients from sticking and burning; set it in a quick Oven for about an Hour, and so have you a Composition for any Root-Pudding.</i></p>
<p><i>45. Parsnep, Pastinaca, Carrot: first boil'd, being cold, is of it self a Winter-Sallet, eaten with Oyl, Vinegar, &amp;c. and having something of Spicy, is by some, thought more nourishing than the Turnep.</i></p>
<p><b>John Evelyn�s Kalendarium Hortense,&nbsp; or Gard'ners Almanac of 1699</b>,&nbsp; (below left) gave directions on what the gardener is to do throughout the year. It describes the correct methods of sowing and tending for carrots on a monthly basis throughout the year, recommending sowing seeds in February and March and then in August he recommended "to strip down the leaves of carrots to improve the roots ".</p>

<p>John Fryer who travelled through India and Persia between 1672 to 1681 noted that Car<img border="0" src="photos/salmon1695.JPG" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="305" height="368" alt="Salmon Pudding recipe 1695" />rots grew in Persia.<i>(Laufer)</i></p>
<p>In Huishoudelijk Woordenboek (Domestic Dictionary), the most popular encyclopedia for agriculture and domestic use from the eighteenth century, the author&nbsp; Noel Chomel (1632-1712) describes no less than five common species of (ordinary) yellow carrots. First Chomel cites the most common type Leidsche geele (Leyden yellow) and the fifth and last place is for the little orange coloured carrot, commonly called early Hoornsche carrot. The Leiden and Hoornsche carrot differ in shape, size, flavour and colour.</p>
<p>The small Hoornsche is less in demand by the commoner people) than the coarser Leiden type. Because of the short growing season, and the fact that Hoornsche carrots are tasty and very pleasing to the eye, and pleasant at the tables and tongues of the upper class bourgeoisie gives it an advantage. Chomel classifies the carrots from Hoorn as exclusive than the popular carrot that grows in the vicinity of Leiden. Chomel also describes the most common preparation methods for the common carrot, which is braised in pieces but also cooked with braised beef or mutton and much used in hutspot (hotchpot) from Gelderland. Young Hoornse small carrots, according Chomel, are the tastiest in soup.</p>
<p>In William Salmon�s work � �The family dictionary or household companion� 1695, he likens red carrots to beets, which at that time were carrot shaped until later selected out for roundness; he treated red rooty beets and red carrots almost interchangeable in his pudding recipe. This book is both cookery book and a compendium of information for the homemaker. (extract above right)</p>
