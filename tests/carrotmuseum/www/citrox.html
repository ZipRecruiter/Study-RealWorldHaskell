<p align="left"><b>Citrox - ProAlexin�</b>&nbsp; - This product aims to assist agricultural producers to achieve gains without the use of toxic chemicals. They are designed to activate, and enhance synergistically, the plants production of phytoalexins thus countering the risk of damage from plant-attacking pathogens.</p>
<p>This reduces the stress on the plant and promotes plant vigour, resulting in a healthier plant giving better yields through improved nutrition. The benefits, as observed during field trials, are a reduction in the number of fertilizers and insecticides required, higher yields and higher grade quality produce.</p>
<p align="left">This is the natural alternative to synthetic biocides for the decontamination of fruits and vegetables. Farmers and fresh produce processors use every year thousands <img border="0" src="photos/citroxlogo.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="citrox logo" width="240" height="145" />of tonnes of chemicals to treat their fruit and vegetable produce. Inevitably some of the chemicals remain on the food as undesirable residues. In addition to the chemical residues problem, the risk of contamination is increased because the produce is repeatedly handled during preparation packing and transport. It has been estimated that as many as twenty people may have handled produce before it reaches the consumer. Even where produce has been organically grown it can be exposed to deposits from vehicle exhaust fumes, atmospheric grime and insects. In many establishments preparing produce, the treatment given is no more than a water wash, and this has little effect since the substances applied during farming are designed not to be washed off by rainfall. Clearly a more powerful and more effective washing agent is needed to remove these harmful, and potentially toxic, residues.
