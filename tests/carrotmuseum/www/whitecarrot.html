<p align="justify">White carrots have a mild, sweet flavour. Cultivars include Snow White, Lunar White, and White Satin (<img border="0" src="photos/whitesatin4sm.jpg" alt="White Satin Carrots" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" width="315" height="312" />photo right). Many people believe that the white carrots found in the speciality stores are "just parsnips", this is not true.&nbsp; Parsnip is in the carrot family but a separate species. Parsnips tend to have a more golden brown or ivory colour and a more nutty taste, and they tend to be larger. Parsnip is pastinaca sativus.</p>
<p align="justify">The carrot has traditionally been known as an orange vegetable. Generations of people in the West have grown up believing that carrots have always been orange. But long before the Orange carrot became established in the 15th century,&nbsp; the white carrot (Daucus carota ssp. sativus) grew in Europe, often fed to cattle but also consumed by humans.</p>
<p align="justify">Cultivated carrots originated in the Afghanistan region and were yellow and purple. From this center of domestication carrots were grown as a root crop to the East and West with the incorporation of several characteristics contrasting those two geographic regions. The Eastern carrot spread to central and north Asia and then to Japan. Red coloured carrot is typical for India and also was introduced to Japan. In contrast, Western carrot type is characterized initially by yellow and later by orange root colour.</p>
<p align="justify">This carrot type spread to West and now dominates in Europe and America. Carrot is rich in pro-healthy antioxidants both of lipophylic (carotenoids) and hydrophilic (phenolic compounds) characters. Although carotenoid content varies considerably among carrot genotypes, usually orange carrots contain high amounts of α- and β- carotene; yellow carrots contain lutein, the red color of carrots is due to lycopene, while polyphenol substances, mostly anthocyanins are typical for purple roots.</p>
<p align="justify">The colour of yellow, orange and red carrots is the result of certain carotenoid pigments present in the root. These carotenoids can be divided into hydrocarbon pigments or carotenes and oxygenated pigments or xanthophylls.</p>
<p align="justify"><img border="0" src="photos/whitebuncha.jpg" width="450" height="379" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" /><font color="#FF0000"><b>White carrot</b></font> &nbsp;- White carrots are pigment-free and they contain phytochemicals that work with nutrients and dietary fibre to protect against diseases like colon cancer. The phytochemicals in white carrots can also help reduce the risk of stroke. White carrots are good for carotene allergy sufferers. These varieties are very low in total carotenoid content and&nbsp;lack any pigmentation hence the presence of the white colour. They tend to have a smoother flavour than orange carrots.</p>
<p align="justify">They do contain naturally occurring, health-promoting substances, called phytochemicals, natural bioactive compounds found in plant foods that work with nutrients and dietary fibre to protect against disease. One might say these are the least healthy of carrots but nevertheless have a rich taste.&nbsp; These chemicals may be important in reducing the risk of atherosclerosis, which is the build up of fatty deposits in artery walls. White carrots are preferably used in baby foods to prevent them from forming orange skin. White carrots are not a significant source of bioavailable carotenoids.</p>
<div align="center"></div>
<p align="justify">Historical references to carrot and parsnip are often intertwined; early medieval carrots and parsnips were both thin and woody and mostly of a vaguely whitish colour. This being the case, almost everyone up to the early modern period can perhaps be forgiven for failing to distinguish between the two, however frustrating this may be for the food and agricultural historian.<br />

Nature then took a hand and produced mutants and natural hybrids, crossing both with cultivated and wild varieties. It is considered that purple/yellow carrots were then taken westwards where orange varieties were developed from&nbsp;yellow ones. Finally some motivated Dutch growers took these mutant orange carrots under their horticultural wings and developed them to be sweeter and more practical. White carrots, which were the most prevalent in Europe until the 16th century were superseded by the better tasting orange variety.&nbsp; Before that they were predominantly grown as animal fodder and only occasionally as human food.</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In Roman times carrots were purple or white. By the 10th century purple carrots were grown in Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern Iran. Purple, white and yellow carrots were imported to southern Europe in the 14th century. Black, red and white carrots were also grown.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Health Benefits</b></p>
<p>Though the white carrot is considered as having the least health benefits due to lack of pigment, the other compounds like phytochemicals in these carrots can help reduce the risk of cancer and stroke<font face="Arial">. Also t</font>he dietary fibre in these carrots help fight against colon cancer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The white carrot is a solution for people who have a carotene-allergy. They are as tasty as orange carrots, but white carrots look less attractive. White carrots are also good for digestion.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Reasons to Grow White Carrots</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They are a good alternative to the "traditional" orange colour. Carrots were originally white (and purple) and from Afghanistan before they cross bred to get the orange colour. They have phytochemicals which occur naturally in the plant to help with nutrients in our body and help prevent disease.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">White carrots are said to be sweeter and juicer than orange carrots. White carrots are not "novelty" carrots genetically modified to produce this effect. They are good sources of dietary fibre and good for carotene allergy sufferers.</p>
