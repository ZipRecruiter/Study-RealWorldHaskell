<p align="left">One of Canada's biggest carrot producing areas is Bradford, where, every year the Annual Carrot Fest takes place. <img border="0" src="Bradford/bfdcontact.gif" align="right" width="222" height="162" /><br />
It celebrates the area's agricultural heritage and the important role played by the carrot in the economy. Bradford West Gwillimbury alone supplies Ontario with 99% of all of their carrots AND onions! This means that Bradford also supplies Canada with 50% of their carrots and 60% of their onions<br />

<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><b><a name="croissy"></a>Fï¿½te de la Carotte - Annual Carrot Festival&nbsp; - Croissy sur Seine - September</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><b>A tradition since 1860!</b><img border="0" src="photos/croissy11.jpg" width="180" height="302" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="5" /><br />
<br />
At the end of the 18th century, Croissy discovered a vocation for itself as a gardening village located 12 kilometres from the main food markets of Paris (the main one in Paris is known as Les Halles). Thanks to a predominantly sandy terrain, a plain which is sheltered from the western winds, and underlying ground water (possibly an aquifer), the village very rapidly became the queen of the markets - and remained so until the 1970ï¿½s.&nbsp; It gained a reputation for her famous vegetables used in making pot-au-feu, of which the carrot was of superior quality.</p>
<p align="left">In 1860, the first community festival of Croissy was held. With the rapid development of market gardening, Croissy became the natural choice for the festival of the carrot. The queen of the markets has therefore been celebrated for nearly 150 years in Croissy every second weekend of September.</p>
<p><b>6, 7 and 8 September 2008</b></p>
<p>It is the traditional festival of Croissy sur Seine, "carrot capital" since the mid&nbsp; 19th century. As ancestral home to the&nbsp;vegetable which once gave glory to this&nbsp;former market-gardening town, Croissy pays homage to the carrot with an annual&nbsp;festival held on &nbsp;the second weekend of September.<br />

<p><font face="Arial">The day starts off with a market with local organisations and also visitors having stalls which range from the local food through to a blacksmith working on a forge. Entertainment is provided by local as well as visiting artists, demonstrations by local organizations, Karate, Aerobics, Childrenï¿½s Dance, competitions run by retailers for best decorated shop windows, Carrot poems, Vegetable sculptures, wearable art, a shoppers draw (usually $1000), and last but not least, the parade of floats, horses and horse drawn vehicles, trucks, tractors and all other forms of motor vehicles.</font></p>

<p>The small town of Creances in Normandy, France celebrates the <i>apiaceae</i> family - or the humble carrot.&nbsp; Crï¿½ances is on the West coast of the Cotentin peninsula, about ten miles north of Coutances. The population of the village is about two thousand in the winter, perhaps five thousand in the Summer, and a whole lot more on the second Saturday in August, when the whole region turns up to celebrate the Feast of the Carrot. Sadly it is not quite the event it could be, read more on the Museum report.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Crï¿½ances have been known for growing a whole range o<font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="photos/sandcarrot.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="sand carrots of Creances, France" width="640" height="100" /></font>f different vegetables since the 13th Century. Carrots, leeks, beetroot and salsify grow in the "mielles" (little fields), a sandy area close to the sea. The reclaimed beaches have been&nbsp; constant applications of seaweed. After a few centuries of this, the soil is rich, deep and incredibly fertile, and produces leeks, onions, pumpkins, shallots, and above all the finest carrots in France.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As growing conditions improved, from about 1919 the local population started selling their produce at markets in the area and as far away as Paris.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Growing carrots took off in a big way once a market garden co-operative was created in 1943. Thanks to the persistence of its members, the quality "Label Rouge" mark was awarded in 1962 to carrots grown in Crï¿½anceï¿½s sandy soil and since 1990 the town has organised a special festival dedicated to its "queen of vegetables", held every second Saturday in August.<img border="0" src="creance/creances4.jpg" width="242" height="321" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></p>
<p>Eight years ago Crï¿½ances was granted the only Appelation d'origine for carrots. Go into any supermarket and you will see French carrots marked either "Origine France" or "Origine Crï¿½ances". The town produces high-quality vegetables, carrots in particular, and every year the local farming community congregates to celebrate its <i>terroir</i> and the local produce with performances, a market, food stalls and music.</p>
<p>It takes place on the second Saturday of every August and admission is free!</p>
<p>There are floats piled high with produce, contests for the finest (judged on taste, not size), and the ceremonies and procession of the Confrï¿½rie des Mï¿½geous de la Bonne Carotte des Sables. Mï¿½geou is a local word, part of the patois that calls the village Crianches. In plain fact, it means mangeur, eater; but in this context its nearest English equivalent would be Panjandrum. The Panjandra of Crï¿½ances wear carrot-coloured robes and (of course) green hats.</p>
<p>The programme includes a parade of carrot growers, the "Mougeous dï¿½Carottes", a cooking competition, a fair open to everyone and musical entertainment.&nbsp; Every year about 25,000 visitors come to join in the fun.</p>
<p>The Fï¿½te de la Carotte is principally a big excuse to sell things to each other. Five hundred stalls line all the streets of the centre, some run by professional junk dealers, some by individuals clearing their attics.</p>
<p>The Second Saturday of every August. 2013 - 10 August. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.canton-lessay.com/web/index.php">details here</a>)</p>

<p align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial" size="4"><a name="aarau"></a>Aurau, Switzerland - November</font><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="photos/aarau1.gif" align="right" width="200" height="90" /></font></b></p>
<p>Always on the first Wednesday in November, the town of Aarau, in Switzerland - known as&nbsp; "The town of beautiful gables" holds its annual&nbsp; "Rï¿½eblimart" (Carrot market).&nbsp; The first one was held in 1981.</p>
<p><i><b>The legend of Rï¿½eblimï¿½rt</b></i> - About 25 years a ago a couple in the Aargauer restaurant ï¿½Monkeys boxï¿½ were having a glass of beer and discussing with their friends about the Zibelemï¿½rit held in Berne every year (Onion Market). They decided that Aarau could also organize a vibrant and successful market in their City to match what was happening in Berne and so the Rï¿½eblimï¿½rt was born.</p>
<p>The first Rï¿½eblimï¿½rt was a modest affair produced with little publicity or advertising and about 30 stalls took part, offering a wide variety of the vegetables grown in the region, together with decorative items. The public interest was so great that by 11 clock in the morning all the stalls were empty!. No one had expected such a success. It has since always been held on the first Wednesday in November, in the Old City Aarau market place, from 7.30 am and over 140 stalls ply their wares and it attracts of 35000 visitors.. A wide variety of goods are sold, carrot cheese, tea, preserves, crafts, pastries, bread, honey, eggs, clothes, crafts and of course every colour of carrots!</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Aarau is a beautiful place - within minutes you can be by the river Aare, in the Jura hills, in the city or going on the Intercity train somewhere; or you can be on the "Riviera" in one of the many pub gardens in Schachen.&nbsp; Also close by is Windisch, a Roman town formerly called Vindinissa and where you can see many remains including the amphitheatre.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Aarau is an attractive location in many different respects. The town is situated between Basel, Berne, Lucerne and Zurich.<br />
Aarau is certainly picturesque with many painted gable roofs on the numerous houses in the Old Town which are unique.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The County holds its Annual Carrot Festival in September. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.agudatachim.com/carrot-festival">Website here.</a><br />
<br />
What's all the fuss about Carrots in New York?&nbsp; and why a Festival?&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="style13"><font size="3"><img border="0" src="photos/cake2.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="10" width="296" height="235" />Begun in 1978 as a modest farmers market, Congregation Agudat Achimï¿½s annual mid-September Carrot Festival has evolved into an eagerly awaited mega-autumn harvest fair and community carnival, featuring arts, crafts, games and musical entertainment.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">From humble beginnings Carrot festival has turned into a huge event that is enjoyed by the entire community. The event showcases foods and desserts from all over the world including carrot cake, local produce, music and entertainment, vendors and crafters, a miniature health fair, and plenty of activities to keep kids entertained.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="style13"><font size="3">Huge crowds from all over New York and surrounding states spill across the expansive front lawn of the synagogue to enjoy wonderful food cooked al fresco. The visitors stroll among artistsï¿½ and craftersï¿½ stalls and display tables piled high with succulent produce trucked in from nearby Schoharie Valley farms.<span class="fixed"><b><img border="0" src="photos/nyfest1.jpg" align="right" width="423" height="233" vspace="3" /></b></span></font></p>
<p><font size="3">If you like fun and music, carrot cakes, carrot bagels and other carrot goodies, Multi-cultural foods, and if you are looking for children's activities and a chance to buy plants and farm-fresh produce, and to shop at 50 craft booths, you'll love the Schenectady County Carrot&nbsp; Festival. Held whether it rains or shines!!</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Over 25 years ago one of the local farmers and some of his friends thought they could have a celebration that featured their farm's most important crop - the Carrot. Since then the carrots have kept growing and so has the Festival. Today it is one of the area's most popular September activities.<br />
<br />
<span class="fixed"><img border="0" src="photos/cake1.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="225" height="180" /></span>Previous Carrot Festivals have featured - the 5K Carrot Run, and the business and professional tent fresh organic produce from Schoharie County; honey and plants; over 40 craft tables; fun for the kids; and, of course, the Walking Carrot.&nbsp; Sounds like great fun!<br />
<br />
The festivalï¿½s crowning glory is its incomparable slate of carrot-based baked goods, the festivalï¿½s signature carrot cakes, crowned by a heavenly two-layer praline filled carrot cake, topped with a lush cream cheese frosting. The other carrot cakes are prepared non dairy.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">They include applesauce carrot cake, banana chocolate chip carrot cake, zucchini carrot loaf, chunky apple cake, traditional carrot strudel, contemporary apple carrot strudel and pineapple carrot cake with streusel topping.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The village of Cuevas Bajas is blessed with a unique variety of carrot, the so-called "carrot morï¿½", famous for its purple outer and unique centre. This peculiarity distinguishes this product from the rest of the known carrot festivals, which as we all know usually have an orange colour.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">What distinguishes this carrot is that when it is sliced the core it has an orange colour, just as the traditional carrot, but it uniquely has a purple heart.&nbsp; It is said that the Arabs brought this variety from North Africa to Andalusia via the Silk Road in the 14th century.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The festival is in its ninth year (2015) commencing with a carrot market, followed by children's activities, tasting bar with local wine and sausages, crumbs with the purple carrot and lots more! It has been declared a Festival of Tourist Singularity by the Junta de Andalucï¿½a.</font></p>

If you have any more information please contact the Carrot Museum.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">The event, organized by the Cayastï¿½ Commune, pays tribute to the participants in the production and consumption of local carrots. There were tastings of artisan dishes based on carrots, dances, popular music, election of the Carrot Queen and a mega fireworks show.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Among the speciality dishes were carrot cheese cake, ricotta and carrot cake, carrot chutney, carrot yogurt, carrot cake, and a main dish with local products: roll of fish and vegetables, with risotto and carrot sauce.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">The carrot has been grown in the coastal region of Santa Fe for decades. Its production began around 1950, since then it has been heavily developed and represents an important source of wealth and work for the area.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">The purple carrot of Tiggiano is also known as Pestanaca or Carrot of Saint Ippazio, from the patron saint of the city of Tiggiano, Ippazio.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The qualities of this carrot were already known in ancient times, and even today it is still much sought after. It is a purple carrot with yellow stripes, medium large in size, elongated and irregular in shape. It is crunchy, juicy and very fragrant. It is a carrot of excellent qualities but of short duration. In fact, after 2-3 days the product shrivels and loses turgidity, for this reason it must be consumed in a day or two.<br /></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><img border="0" src="photos/tiggiano01sm.jpg" alt="tiggiano Italy carrot" align="center" width="772" height="514" /></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Tiggiano carrot needs particular rich soils with high phosphate content. It is cultivated in July, fertilized with mature manure from the previous crop and irrigated twice a day. Harvest must be done by hand to avoid damaging the product.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">This carrot is used in various local recipes, such as in "Ravioli with Pestanaca", Pestanaca cake, or in yogurts and liqueurs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">In mid January the town of Tiggiano holds the Festival of Pestanaca.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">On the occasion of the Festa di Sant'Ippazio, the municipality of Tiggiano revives the traditional event with the 'Festival of Pestanaca', a local variety of the more common carrot, from which it is distinguished by the colour, yellowish violet, and especially for the sweet aromatic taste that is more refined and more distinct. The species is cultivated in the farms of Tiggiano, linked to the figure of St Ippazio, enough to be called ï¿½Pestanaca de Santu Patiï¿½, and is respected by the people for its form as a male genital apparatus of which the saint is the patron. During the event, which takes place in Piazza Aldo Moro, a tasting of several typical sweet and savoury dishes, all Pestanaca-based, is offered.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Sant'Ippazio (St. Hypatius of Gangra) is a saint, martyr, and advocate in cases of impotency, inguinal hernia, and other abdominal disorders. In Tiggiano, a small town at the southernmost point of Italy, Sant'Ippazio, bishop of Gangra, is venerated as a patron saint. According to legend, during an excited dispute on the question of the Arian heresy at the synod of Nicaea (325 AD), Bishop Ippazio was kicked in the lower abdominal region by an Arian presbyter, which caused an inguinal hernia. Therefore, his help is sought for relief and cure of hernia or impotency. Every January 19th, the day of the parish fair, particular carrots (the "pastinache") which have a reddish to violet colour are sold. They are said to be similar to the saint's penis after the kick.</font></p>

<p><img border="0" src="photos/hmoon05.jpg" alt="harvest moon carrot bag" align="left" width="410" height="273" hspace="5" vspace="5" />Harvest Moon celebrated its inaugural Carrot Festival on April 6, 2019. The crux of the carrot festival is to try, in a fun way, to educate consumers, kids and mums and dads on how great "Tassie" carrots are, and it's. is all about trying to increase the&nbsp; consumption of carrots Australia-wide.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Harvest Moon Farm was packed with carrot treats to taste such as the new Snackables in punnets, carrot scones and carrot cakes all washed down with a fresh carrot juice. The Easter Bunny dropped in, and kids could go on a treasure hunt in the garden.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Carrot Festival patrons took part in factory tours to see how the crop is processed and packed for market and the t</span>ours were extremely popular, selling out a week before the event, with over 300 people taking the opportunity to tour the facility. Over 400 people came out on the day, with the signature Harvest Moon sausage (containing carrot of course), and maple-glazed baby carrots available on the BBQ! Carrot, apple and beetroot juice was on offer, along with mini carrot cakes and carrot scones. They offered lots of fun activities for the kids including face painting, a drawing and colouring in competition, a carrot hunt in the garden and the opportunity to jump up on a tractor.</p>
<p>Harvest Moon was founded in 1981, and has been growing carrots for over 30 years. It is a privately-owned business, currently operated by founder and Managing Director Neil Armstrong and Agricultural Director Mark Kable. They pack around 14,000 tonnes of carrots between January and June each year.</p>
<p>Carrots are the largest vegetable commodity, but they also grow broccoli, onions, cauliflowers, cabbage, beetroot, swede, beans, potatoes and baby spinach. Around 60,000 tonnes of vegetables are produced annually, and the employee numbers swell to around 350 in the season. In addition to the head office in Forth, Tasmania, they have sites in Werribee (Victoria) and Gatton (Queensland).&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.harvestmoon.com.au/">Harvest Moon website here.</a></p>
