### lists & tuples
1. What are the types of the following expressions?
  1. False
  2. (["foo", "bar"], 'a')
  3. [(True, []), (False, [['a']])]

### chapter 2
1. Haskell provides a standard function, last :: [a] -> a, that returns the last element of a list. From reading the type alone, what are the possible valid behaviours (omitting crashes and infinite loops) that this function could have? What are a few things that this function clearly cannot do?
2. Write a function lastButOne, that returns the element before the last. 150 comments
3. Load your lastButOne function into ghci, and try it out on lists of different lengths. What happens when you pass it a list that's too short? No comments
