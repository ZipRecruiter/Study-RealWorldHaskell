-- 1. Write your own "safe" definitions of the standard partial list
--    functions, but make sure that yours never fail. As a hint, you
--    might want to consider using the following types. (Included. â€”EQW)
safeHead :: [a] -> Maybe a
safeHead []    = Nothing
safeHead (x:_) = Just x

safeTail :: [a] -> Maybe [a]
safeTail []     = Nothing

-- I'm sure there's a better way to do this,
-- but I'm mostly just playing around.

-- 2. Takes a predicate and a list of any type and splits its input
--    list on every element for which the predicate returns `False`.
